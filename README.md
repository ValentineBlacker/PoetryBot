PoetryBot!!!

PoetryBot is an insane mess and should not be used by anyone. Please enjoy your use of PoetryBot.

To Use: You're gonna need Python3 and NLTK. And probably some other stuff. Maybe someday I'll make this into a real package.
Put any source texts you want to use in 'sourcemats'. The business end of this thing is at the bottom of makeAHeckinPoem.py. outputToFile will dump to a file, outputToConsole to a console. They both take a list of the texts you want to use as sources. You can manipulate these functions to make rhyming or prose poems. IDK knock yourself out.
