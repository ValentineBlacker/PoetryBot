	

ONCE upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore 
While I nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
T is some visiter I muttered tapping at my chamber door 
Only this and nothing more
Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow;  vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow  sorrow for the lost Lenore 
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore 
Nameless here for evermore

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me  filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating
T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door 
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; 
This it is and nothing more
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer
Sir said I or Madam truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping and so gently you came rapping
And so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door
That I scarce was sure I heard you"  here I opened wide the door;
Darkness there and nothing more
Deep into that darkness peering long I stood there wondering fearing
Doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word Lenore?

This I whispered and an echo murmured back the word Lenore!
Merely this and nothing more
Back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before
Surely said I surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore 
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; 
T is the wind and nothing more!
Open here I flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door 
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door 
Perched and sat and nothing more
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou I said art sure no craven

Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore 
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Nights Plutonian shore!
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
Though its answer little meaning  little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door 
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
With such name as Nevermore
But the Raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only
That one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
Nothing farther then he uttered  not a feather then he fluttered 
Till I scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown before 
On the morrow he will leave me as my Hopes have flown before
Then the bird said Nevermore
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
Doubtless said I what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
  
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore 
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of Never  nevermore
But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then upon the velvet sinking I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore 
What this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking Nevermore
This I sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core;
This and more I sat divining with my head at ease reclining
On the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer
But whose velvetviolet lining with the lamplight gloating oer
She shall press ah nevermore!
Then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
Wretch I cried thy God hath lent thee  by these angels he hath sent thee
  
Respite  respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Prophet! said I thing of evil!  prophet still if bird or devil! 
Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
Desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted 
On this home by Horror haunted  tell me truly I implore 
Is there  is there balm in Gilead?  tell me  tell me I implore!
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Prophet! said I thing of evil!  prophet still if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us  by that God we both adore 
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidenn
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore 
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend! I shrieked upstarting 
Get thee back into the tempest and the Nights Plutonian shore!
  
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!  quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door!
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
And the Raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming
And the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted  nevermore!


ONCE it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell;
They had gone unto the wars
Trusting to the mildeyed stars
Nightly from their azure towers
To keep watch above the flowers
In the midst of which all day
The red sunlight lazily lay
Now each visiter shall confess
The sad valleys restlessness
Nothing there is motionless 
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude
Ah by no wind are stirred those trees
That palpitate like the chill seas
Around the misty Hebrides!
Ah by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
Uneasily from morn till even
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye 
Over the lilies there that wave
And weep above a nameless grave!
They wave:  from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops
They weep:  from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems
  

THE ring is on my hand
And the wreath is on my brow;
Satins and jewels grand
Are all at my command
And I am happy now
And my lord he loves me well;
But when first he breathed his vow
I felt my bosom swell 
For the words rang as a knell
And the voice seemed his who fell
In the battle down the dell
And who is happy now
But he spoke to reassure me
And he kissed my pallid brow
While a reverie came oer me
And to the churchyard bore me
And I sighed to him before me
Thinking him dead DElormie
Oh I am happy now!
And thus the words were spoken;
And this the plighted vow;
And though my faith be broken
And though my heart be broken
Here is a ring as token
That I am happy now! 
Behold the golden token
That proves me happy now!
  
Would God I could awaken!
For I dream I know not how
And my soul is sorely shaken
Lest an evil step be taken 
Lest the dead who is forsaken
May not be happy now
  


AT midnight in the month of June
I stand beneath the mystic moon
An opiate vapor dewy dim
Exhales from out her golden rim
And softly dripping drop by drop
Upon the quiet mountain top
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley
The rosemary nods upon the grave;
The lily lolls upon the wave;
Wrapping the fog about its breast
The ruin moulders into rest;
Looking like Lethe see! the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take
And would not for the world awake
All Beauty sleeps!  and lo! where lies
Irene with her Destinies!
Oh lady bright! can it be right 
This window open to the night?
The wanton airs from the treetop
Laughingly through the lattice drop 
The bodiless airs a wizard rout
Flit through thy chamber in and out
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully  so fearfully 
Above the closed and fring�d lid
Neath which thy slumbring soul lies hid
That oer the floor and down the wall
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
  
Oh lady dear hast thou no fear?
Why and what art thou dreaming here?
Sure thou art come oer faroff seas
A wonder to these garden trees!
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
Strange above all thy length of tress
And this all solemn silentness!
The lady sleeps! Oh may her sleep
Which is enduring so be deep!
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
This chamber changed for one more holy
This bed for one more melancholy
I pray to God that she may lie
Forever with unopened eye
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!
My love she sleeps! Oh may her sleep
As it is lasting so be deep!
Soft may the worms about her creep!
Far in the forest dim and old
For her may some tall vault unfold 
Some vault that oft hath flung its black
And wing�d panels fluttering back
Triumphant oer the crested palls
Of her grand family funerals 
Some sepulchre remote alone
Against whose portal she hath thrown
In childhood many an idle stone 
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She neer shall force an echo more
Thrilling to think poor child of sin!
It was the dead who groaned within


TYPE of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary
Of lofty contemplation left to Time
By buried centuries of pomp and power!
At length  at length  after so many days
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst
Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie
I kneel an altered and an humble man
Amid thy shadows and so drink within
My very soul thy grandeur gloom and glory!
Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!
Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!
I feel ye now  I feel ye in your strength 
O spells more sure than eer Jud�an king
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!
Here where a hero fell a column falls!
Here where the mimic eagle glared in gold
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
Here where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
Waved to the wind now wave the reed and thistle!
Here where on golden throne the monarch lolled
Glides spectrelike unto his marble home
Lit by the wan light of the horn�d moon
The swift and silent lizard of the stones!
  
But stay! these walls  these ivyclad arcades 
These mouldering plinths  these sad and blackened shafts 
These vague entablatures  this crumbling frieze 
These shattered cornices  this wreck  this ruin 
These stones  alas! these gray stones  are they all 
All of the famed and the colossal left
By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?
Not all  the Echoes answer me  not all!
Prophetic sounds and loud arise forever
From us and from all Ruin unto the wise
As melody from Memnon to the Sun
We rule the hearts of mightiest men  we rule
With a despotic sway all giant minds
We are not impotent  we pallid stones
Not all our power is gone  not all our fame 
Not all the magic of our high renown 
Not all the wonder that encircles us 
Not all the mysteries that in us lie 
Not all the memories that hang upon
And cling around about us as a garment
Clothing us in a robe of more than glory
  

AH broken is the golden bowl!  the spirit flown for ever!
Let the bell toll!  a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river: 
And Guy De Vere hast thou no tear?  weep now or never more!
See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love Lenore!
Come let the burial rite be read  the funeral song be sung! 
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young 
A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young
Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and ye hated her for her pride;
And when she fell in feeble health ye blessed her  that she died: 
How shall the ritual then be read  the requiem how be sung
By you  by yours the evil eye  by yours the slanderous tongue
That did to death the innocence that died and died so young?
Peccavimus: yet rave not thus! but let a Sabbath song
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!
  
The sweet Lenore hath gone before with Hope that flew beside
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride 
For her the fair and debonnaire that now so lowly lies
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes 
The life still there upon her hair the death upon her eyes
Avaunt!  avaunt! to friends from fiends the indignant ghost is riven 
From Hell unto a high estate within the utmost Heaven 
From moan and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven: 
Let no bell toll then lest her soul amid its hallowed mirth
Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damn�d Earth!
And I  tonight my heart is light:  no dirge will I upraise
But waft the angel on her flight with a p�an of old days!
  

AT morn  at noon  at twilight dim 
Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
In joy and wo  in good and ill 
Mother of God be with me still!
When the Hours flew brightly by
And not a cloud obscured the sky
My soul lest it should truant be
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;
Now when storms of Fate oercast
Darkly my Present and my Past
Let my Future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine!
  



IN Heaven a spirit doth dwell
Whose heartstrings are a lute;
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel
And the giddy stars so legends tell
Ceasing their hymns attend the spell
Of his voice all mute
Tottering above
In her highest noon
The enamoured Moon
Blushes with love
While to listen the red levin
With the rapid Pleiads even
Which were seven
Pauses in Heaven
And they say the starry choir
And the other listening things
That Israfelis fire
Is owing to that lyre
By which he sits and sings 
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings
But the skies that angel trod
Where deep thoughts are a duty 
Where Loves a grownup god 
  
Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
Which we worship in a star
Therefore thou art not wrong
Israfeli who despisest
An unimpassioned song;
To thee the laurels belong
Best bard because the wisest!
Merrily live and long!
The ecstasies above
With thy burning measures suit 
Thy grief thy joy thy hate thy love
With the fervor of thy lute 
Well may the stars be mute!
Yes Heaven is thine; but this
Is a world of sweets and sours;
Our flowers are merely  flowers
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
Is the sunshine of ours
If I could dwell
Where Israfel
Hath dwelt and he where I
He might not sing so wildly well
A mortal melody
While a bolder note than this might swell
From my lyre within the sky
  


BY a route obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only
Where an Eidolon named NIGHT
On a black throne reigns upright
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule 
From a wild weird clime that lieth sublime
Out of Space  out of Time
Bottomless vales and boundless floods
And chasms and caves and Titan woods
With forms that no man can discover
For the dews that drip all over;
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore;
Seas that restlessly aspire
Surging unto skies of fire;
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters  lone and dead 
Their still waters  still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily
By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters lone and dead 
Their sad waters sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily 
By the mountains  near the river
Murmuring lowly murmuring ever 
  
By the grey woods  by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp 
By the dismal tarns and pools
Where dwell the ghouls 
By each spot the most unholy 
In each nook most melancholy 
There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the Past 
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by 
Whiterobed forms of friends long given
In agony to the Earth  and Heaven
For the heart whose woes are legion
T is a peaceful soothing region 
For the spirit that walks in shadow
O! it is an Eldorado!
But the traveller travelling through it
May not  dare not openly view it;
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed;
So wills its King who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fring�d lid;
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses
By a route obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only
Where an Eidolon named NIGHT
On a black throne reigns upright
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule
  


FAIR isle that from the fairest of all flowers
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!
How many memories of what radiant hours
At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
How many scenes of what departed bliss!
How many thoughts of what entomb�d hopes!
How many visions of a maiden that is
No more  no more upon thy verdant slopes!
No more! alas that magical sad sound
Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no more 
Thy memory no more! Accurs�d ground
Henceforth I hold thy flowerenamelled shore
O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!
Isola doro! Fior di Levante!
  

Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest
There shrines and palaces and towers
Timeeaten towers that tremble not!
Resemble nothing that is ours
Around by lifting winds forgot
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie
No rays from the holy heaven come down
On the long nighttime of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently 
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free 
Up domes  up spires  up kingly halls 
Up fanes  up Babylonlike walls 
Up shadowy longforgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers 
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreath�d friezes intertwine
The viol the violet and the vine
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air
  
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down
There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idols diamond eye 
Not the gaylyjeweled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl alas!
Along that wilderness of glass 
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some faroff happier sea 
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene
But lo a stir is in the air!
The wave  there is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside
In slightly sinking the dull tide 
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven
The waves have now a redder glow 
The hours are breathing faint and low 
And when amid no earthly moans
Down down that town shall settle hence
Hell rising from a thousand thrones
Shall do it reverence
  


THOU wast that all to me love
For which my soul did pine 
A green isle in the sea love
A fountain and a shrine
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers
And all the flowers were mine
Ah dream too bright to last!
Ah starry Hope! that didst arise
But to be overcast!
A voice from out the Future cries
On! on!  but oer the Past
Dim gulf! my spirit hovering lies
Mute motionless aghast!
For alas! alas! with me
The light of Life is oer!
No more  no more  no more 
Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore
Shall bloom the thunderblasted tree
Or the stricken eagle soar!
And all my days are trances
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy grey eye glances
And where thy footstep gleams 
In what ethereal dances
By what eternal streams
  


I DWELT alone
In a world of moan
And my soul was a stagnant tide
Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride 
Till the yellowhaired young Eulalie became my smiling bride
Ah less  less bright
The stars of the night
Than the eyes of the radiant girl!
And never a flake
That the vapor can make
With the moontints of purple and pearl
Can vie with the modest Eulalies most unregarded curl 
Can compare with the brighteyed Eulalies most humble and careless curl
Now Doubt  now Pain
Come never again
For her soul gives me sigh for sigh
And all day long
Shines bright and strong
Astart� within the sky
While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye 
While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye
  


THOU wouldst be loved?  then let thy heart
From its present pathway part not!
Being everything which now thou art
Be nothing which thou art not
So with the world thy gentle ways
Thy grace thy more than beauty
Shall be an endless theme of praise
And love  a simple duty
  


BELOVED! amid the earnest woes
That crowd around my earthly path 
Drear path alas! where grows
Not even one lonely rose 
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee and therein knows
An Eden of bland repose
And thus thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted faroff isle
In some tumultuous sea 
Some ocean throbbing far and free
With storms  but where meanwhile
Serenest skies continually
Just oer that one bright island smile
  


THERE are some qualities  some incorporate things
That have a double life which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
From matter and light evinced in solid and shade
There is a twofold Silence  sea and shore 
Body and soul One dwells in lonely places
Newly with grass oergrown; some solemn graces
Some human memories and tearful lore
Render him terrorless: his names No More
He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
No power hath he of evil in himself;
But should some urgent fate untimely lot!
Bring thee to meet his shadow nameless elf
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man commend thyself to God!
  


Lo! t is a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years!
An angel throng bewinged bedight
In veils and drowned in tears
Sit in a theatre to see
A play of hopes and fears
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres
Mimes in the form of God on high
Mutter and mumble low
And hither and thither fly 
Mere puppets they who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
That shift the scenery to and fro
Flapping from out their Condor wings
Invisible wo!
That motley drama  oh be sure
It shall not be forgot!
With its phantom chased for evermore
By a crowd that seize it not
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the selfsame spot
And much of Madness and more of Sin
And Horror the soul of the plot
But see amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude!
  
A bloodred thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude!
It writhes!  it writhes!  with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food
And seraphs sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued
Out  out are the lights  out all!
And over each quivering form
The curtain a funeral pall
Comes down with the rush of a storm
While the angels all pallid and wan
Uprising unveiling affirm
That the play is the tragedy Man
And its hero the Conqueror Worm
  


IN the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted
Once a fair and stately palace 
Radiant palace  reared its head
In the monarch Thoughts dominion 
It stood there!
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair!
Banners yellow glorious golden
On its roof did float and flow
This  all this  was in the olden
Time long ago
And every gentle air that dallied
In that sweet day
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid
A wing�d odor went away
Wanderers in that happy valley
Through two luminous windows saw
Spirits moving musically
To a lutes welltun�d law
Round about a throne where sitting
Porphyrogene
In state his glory well befitting
The ruler of the realm was seen
And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door
  
Through which came flowing flowing flowing
And sparkling evermore
A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
Was but to sing
In voices of surpassing beauty
The wit and wisdom of their king
But evil things in robes of sorrow
Assailed the monarchs high estate
Ah let us mourn!  for never morrow
Shall dawn upon him desolate!
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed
Is but a dimremembered story
Of the oldtime entombed
And travellers now within that valley
Through the encrimsond windows see
Vast forms that move fantastically
To a discordant melody
While like a ghastly rapid river
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
And laugh  but smile no more
  



IHEAR the sledges with the bells 
Silver bells!
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle tinkle tinkle
In the icy air of night!
While the stars that oversprinkle
All the Heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight;
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells 
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells

Hear the mellow wedding bells 
Golden bells!
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight! 
From the moltengolden notes
And all in time
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtledove that listens while she gloats
On the moon!
  
Oh from out the sounding cells
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
How it swells!
How it dwells
On the future!  how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells bells bells 
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells 
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

Hear the loud alarum bells 
Brazen bells!
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!
In the startled ear of Night
How they scream out their affright!
Too much horrified to speak
They can only shriek shriek
Out of tune
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
Leaping higher higher higher
With a desperate desire
And a resolute endeavour
Now  now to sit or never
By the side of the palefaced moon
Oh the bells bells bells!
What a tale their terror tells
Of despair!
  
How they clang and clash and roar!
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
Yet the ear it fully knows
By the twanging
And the clanging
How the danger ebbs and flows;
Yes the ear distinctly tells
In the jangling
And the wrangling
How the danger sinks and swells
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells 
Of the bells 
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells 
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!

Hear the tolling of the bells 
Iron bells!
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
In the silence of the night
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan
And the people  ah the people 
They that dwell up in the steeple
All alone
  
And who tolling tolling tolling
In that muffled monotone
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone 
They are neither man nor woman 
They are neither brute nor human 
They are Ghouls: 
And their king it is who tolls: 
And he rolls rolls rolls
Rolls
A P�an from the bells!
And his merry bosom swells
With the P�an of the bells!
And he dances and he yells;
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the P�an of the bells 
Of the bells: 
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the throbbing of the bells 
Of the bells bells bells 
To the sobbing of the bells: 
Keeping time time time
As he knells knells knells
In a happy Runic rhyme
To the rolling of the bells 
Of the bells bells bells: 
To the tolling of the bells 
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells 
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells
  


OF all who hail thy presence as the morning 
Of all to whom thine absence is the night 
The blotting utterly from out high heaven
The sacred sun  of all who weeping bless thee
Hourly for hope  for life  ah above all
For the resurrection of deepburied faith
In truth in virtue in humanity 
Of all who on despairs unhallowed bed
Lying down to die have suddenly arisen
At thy softmurmured words Let there be light!
At the softmurmured words that were fulfilled
In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes 
Of all who owe thee most whose gratitude
Nearest resembles worship  oh remember
The truest the most fervently devoted
And think that these weak lines are written by him 
By him who as he pens them thrills to think
His spirit is communing with an angels
  


NOT long ago the writer of these lines
In the mad pride of intellectuality
Maintained the power of words  denied that ever
A thought arose within the human brain
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue;
And now as if in mockery of that boast
Two words  two foreign soft dissyllables 
Italian tones made only to be murmured
By angels dreaming in the moonlit dew
That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill 
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart
Unthoughtlike thoughts that are the souls of thought
Richer far wilder far diviner visions
Than even the seraph harper Israfel
Who has the sweetest voice of all Gods creatures
Could hope to utter And I! my spells are broken
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand
With thy dear name as text though bidden by thee
I cannot write  I cannot speak or think
Alas I cannot feel; for t is not feeling
This standing motionless upon the golden
Threshold of the wideopen gate of dreams
Gazing entranced adown the gorgeous vista
And thrilling as I see upon the right
Upon the left and all the way along
Amid empurpled vapors far away
To where the prospect terminates  thee only
  



SELDOM we find says Solomon Don Dunce
Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet
Through all the flimsy things we see at once
As easily as through a Naples bonnet 
Trash of all trash!  how can a lady don it?
Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff 
Owldowny nonsense that the faintest puff
Twirls into trunkpaper the while you con it
And veritably Sol is right enough
The general Petrarchanities are arrant
Bubbles  ephemeral and so transparent 
But this is now  you may depend upon it 
Stable opaque immortal  all by dint
Of the dear names that lie concealed within t
  



I SAW thee once  once only  years ago:
I must not say how many  but not many
It was a July midnight; and from out
A fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring
Sought a precipitant pathway up through heaven
There fell a silverysilken veil of light
With quietude and sultriness and slumber
Upon the upturnd faces of a thousand
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden
Where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe 
Fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
That gave out in return for the lovelight
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death 
Fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
That smiled and died in this parterre enchanted
By thee and by the poetry of thy presence
Clad all in white upon a violet bank
I saw thee half reclining; while the moon
Fell on the upturnd faces of the roses
And on thine own upturnd  alas! in sorrow!
Was it not Fate that on this July midnight 
Was it not Fate whose name is also Sorrow
That bade me pause before that gardengate
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept
  
Save only thee and me I paused  I looked 
And in an instant all things disappeared
Ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted!
The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
The mossy banks and the meandering paths
The happy flowers and the repining trees
Were seen no more: the very roses odors
Died in the arms of the adoring airs
All  all expired save thee  save less than thou:
Save only the divine light in thine eyes 
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes
I saw but them  they were the world to me
I saw but them  saw only them for hours 
Saw only them until the moon went down
What wild hearthistories seemed to lie enwritten
Upon those crystalline celestial spheres!
How dark a wo! yet how sublime a hope!
How silently serene a sea of pride!
How daring an ambition! yet how deep 
How fathomless a capacity for love!
But now at length dear Dian sank from sight
Into a western couch of thundercloud
And thou a ghost amid the entombing trees
Didst glide away Only thine eyes remained
They would not go  they never yet have gone
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night
They have not left me as my hopes have since
They follow me  they lead me through the years
They are my ministers  yet I their slave
Their office is to illumine and enkindle 
My duty to be saved by their bright light
And purified in their electric fire 
  
And sanctified in their elysian fire
They fill my soul with Beauty which is Hope
And are far up in Heaven the stars I kneel to
In the sad silent watches of my night;
While even in the meridian glare of day
I see them still  two sweetly scintillant
Venuses unextinguished by the sun!
  

To   
FOR her these lines are penned whose luminous eyes
Brightly expressive as the twins of L�da
Shall find her own sweet name that nestling lies
Upon this  enwrapped from every reader
Search narrowly this rhyme which holds a treasure
Divine  a talisman  an amulet
That must be worn at heart Search well the measure;
The words  the letters themselves Do not forget
The trivialest point or you may lose your labor
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
Which one might not undo without a sabre
If one could merely understand the plot
Enwritten upon this  whereon are peering
Such eager eyes there lies I say perdu
A wellknown name oft uttered in the hearing
Of poets by poets; as the name is a poets too
Its letters although naturally lying 
Like the knight Pinto Mendez Ferdinando 
Still form a synonym for truth Cease trying!
You will not read the riddle though you do the best you can do
  

THANK Heaven! the crisis 
The danger is past
And the lingering illness
Is over at last 
And the fever called Living
Is conquered at last
Sadly I know
I am shorn of my strength
And no muscle I move
As I lie at full length 
But no matter!  I feel
I am better at length
And I rest so composedly
Now in my bed
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead 
Might start at beholding me
Thinking me dead
The moaning and groaning
The sighing and sobbing
Are quieted now
With that horrible throbbing
At heart:Ah that horrible
Horrible throbbing!
The sickness  the nausea 
The pitiless pain 
  
Have ceased with the fever
That maddened my brain 
With the fever called Living
That burned in my brain
And oh! of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated  the terrible
Torture of thirst
For the napthaline river
Of Passion accurst: 
I have drank of a water
That quenches all thirst: 
Of a water that flows
With a lullaby sound
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground 
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground
But ah! let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed;
For man never slept
In a different bed 
And to sleep you must slumber
In just such a bed
My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes
Forgetting or never
Regretting its roses 
  
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses:
For now while so quietly
Lying it fancies
A holier odor
About it of pansies 
A rosemary odor
Commingled with pansies 
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies
And so it lies happily
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie 
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie
She tenderly kissed me
She fondly caressed
And then I fell gently
To sleep on her breast 
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast
When the light was extinguished
She covered me warm
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm 
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm
  
And I lie so composedly
Now in my bed
Knowing her love
That you fancy me dead 
And I rest so contentedly
Now in my bed
With her love at my breast
That you fancy me dead 
That you shudder to look at me
Thinking me dead: 
But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky
For it sparkles with Annie 
It glows with the light
Of the love of my Annie 
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my Annie
  


BECAUSE the angels in the Heavens above
Devoutly singing unto one another
Can find amid their burning terms of love
None so devotional as that of Mother
Therefore by that sweet name I long have called you;
You who are more than mother unto me
Filling my heart of hearts where God installed you
In setting my Virginias spirit free
My mother  my own mother who died early
Was but the mother of myself; but you
Are mother to the dead I loved so dearly
Are thus more precious than the one I knew
By that infinity with which my wife
Was dearer to my soul than its soul life
  


GAILY bedight
A gallant knight
In sunshine and in shadow
Had journeyed long
Singing a song
In search of Eldorado
But he grew old 
This knight so bold 
And oer his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado
And as his strength
Failed him at length
He met a pilgrim shadow 
Shadow said he
Where can it be 
This land of Eldorado?
Over the Mountains
Of the Moon
Down the Valley of the Shadow
Ride boldly ride
The shade replied 
If you seek for Eldorado!
  
ANNABEL LEE

IT was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee; 
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me
She was a child and I was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love 
I and my Annabel Lee 
With a love that the wing�d seraphs of Heaven
Coveted her and me
And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud by night
Chilling my Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea
The angels not half so happy in Heaven
Went envying her and me: 
Yes! that was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
That the wind came out of the cloud chilling
And killing my Annabel Lee

POES DESK
Used by him at office of the Southern Literary Messenger
  
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we 
Of many far wiser than we 
And neither the angels in Heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee: 
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so all the nighttide I lie down by the side
Of my darling my darling my life and my bride
In her sepulchre there by the sea 
In her tomb by the sounding sea
  


THE skies they were ashen and sober;
The leaves they were crisp�d and sere 
The leaves they were withering and sere:
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year:
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber
In the misty mid region of Weir 
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber
In the ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
Here once through an alley Titanic
Of cypress I roamed with my Soul 
Of cypress with Psyche my Soul
These were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll 
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the Pole 
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanck
In the realms of the Boreal Pole
Our talk had been serious and sober
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere 
Our memories were treacherous and sere;
For we knew not the month was October
And we marked not the night of the year 
Ah night of all nights in the year!
We noted not the dim lake of Auber
Though once we had journeyed down here
  
We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber
Nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
And now as the night was senescent
And stardials pointed to morn 
As the stardials hinted of morn 
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn 
Astartes bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn
And I said  She is warmer than Dian;
She rolls through an ether of sighs 
She revels in a region of sighs 
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks where the worm never dies
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies 
To the Lethean peace of the skies 
Come up in despite of the Lion
To shine on us with her bright eyes 
Come up through the lair of the Lion
With love in her luminous eyes
But Psyche uplifting her finger
Said  Sadly this star I mistrust 
Her pallor I strangely mistrust 
Ah hasten!  Ah let us not linger!
Ah fly!  let us fly!  for we must
In terror she spoke letting sink her
Wings till they trailed in the dust 
  
In agony sobbed; letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust 
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust
I replied  This is nothing but dreaming:
Let us on by this tremulous light!
Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
Its Sybillic splendor is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty tonight: 
See! it flickers up the sky through the night!
Ah we safely may trust to its gleaming
And be sure it will lead us aright 
We surely may trust to a gleaming
That cannot but guide us aright
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her
And tempted her out of her gloom 
And conquered her scruples and gloom;
And we passed to the end of a vista
But were stopped by the door of a tomb 
By the door of a legended tomb;
And I said  What is written sweet sister
On the door of this legended tomb?
She replied  Ulalume  Ulalume! 
T is the vault of thy lost Ulalume!
Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisp�d and sere 
As the leaves that were withering and sere;
And I criedIt was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed  I journeyed down here! 
  
That I brought a dread burden down here 
On this night of all nights in the year
Ah! what demon hath tempted me here?
Well I know now this dim lake of Auber 
This misty mid region of Weir 
Well I know now this dank tarn of Auber 
This ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
Said we then  the two then  Ah can it
Have been that the woodlandish ghouls 
The pitiful the Merciful ghouls 
To bar up our way and to ban it
From the secret that ties in these wolds 
From the thing that lies hidden in these wolds 
Have drawn up the spectre of a planet
From the limbo of lunary souls
This sinfully scintillant planet
From the Hell of the planetary souls?
  
  


KIND solace in a dying hour!
Such father is not now my theme 
I will not madly deem that power
Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
Unearthly pride hath revelld in 
I have no time to dote or dream:
You call it hope  that fire of fire!
It is but agony of desire:
If I can hope  Oh God! I can 
Its fount is holier  more divine 
I would not call thee fool old man
But such is not a gift of thine
Know thou the secret of a spirit
Bowd from its wild pride into shame
O yearning heart! I did inherit
Thy withering portion with the fame
The searing glory which hath shone
Amid the Jewels of my throne
Halo of Hell! and with a pain
Not hell shall make me fear again 
O craving heart for the lost flowers
And sunshine of my summer hours!
The undying voice of that dead time
With its interminable chime
  
Rings in the spirit of a spell
Upon thy emptiness  a knell
I have not always been as now:
The feverd diadem on my brow
I claimd and won usurpingly 
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
Rome to the C�sar  this to me?
The heritage of a kingly mind
And a proud spirit which hath striven
Triumphantly with human kind
On mountain soil I first drew life:
The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews upon my head
And I believe the wing�d strife
And tumult of the headlong air
Have nestled in my very hair
So late from Heaven  that dew  it fell
Mid dreams of an unholy night
Upon me with the touch of Hell
While the red flashing of the light
From clouds that hung like banners oer
Appeared to my halfclosing eye
The antry of monarchy
And the deep trumpetthunders roar
Came hurriedly upon me telling
Of human battle where my voice
My own voice silly child!  was swelling
O! how my spirit would rejoice
And leap within me at the cry
The battlecry of Victory!
  
The rain came down upon my head
Unshelterd  and the heavy wind
Rendered me mad and deaf and blind
It was but man I thought who shed
Laurels upon me: and the rush 
The torrent of the chilly air
Gurgled within my ear the crush
Of empires  with the captives prayer 
The hum of suitors  and the tone
Of flattery round a sovereigns throne
My passions from that hapless hour
Usurpd a tyranny which men
Have deemd since I have reachd to power
My innate nature  be it so:
But father there livd one who then
Then  in my boyhood  when their fire
Burnd with a still intenser glow
For passion must with youth expire
Een then who knew this iron heart
In womans weakness had a part
I have no words  alas!  to tell
The loveliness of loving well!
Nor would I now attempt to trace
The more than beauty of a face
Whose lineaments upon my mind
Are  shadows on th unstable wind:
Thus I remember having dwelt
Some  of early lore upon
With loitering eye till I have felt
The letters  with their meaning  melt
To fantasies  with none
  
O she was worthy of all love!
Love  as in infancy was mine 
T was such as angel minds above
Might envy; her young heart the shrine
On which my every hope and thought
Were incense  then a goodly gift
For they were childish and upright 
Pure  as her young example taught:
Why did I leave it and adrift
Trust to the fire within for light?
We grew in age  and love  together 
Roaming the forest and the wild;
My breast her shield in wintry weather 
And when the friendly sunshine smild
And she would mark the opening skies
I saw no Heaven  but in her eyes
Young Loves first lesson is  the heart:
For mid that sunshine and those smiles
When from our little cares apart
And laughing at her girlish wiles
Id throw me on her throbbing breast
And pour my spirit out in tears 
There was no need to speak the rest 
No need to quiet any fears
Of her  who askd no reason why
But turnd on me her quiet eye!
Yet more than worthy of the love
My spirit struggled with and strove
When on the mountain peak alone
Ambition lent it a new tone 
  
I had no beingbut in thee:
The world and all it did contain
In the earth  the air  the sea 
Its joy  its little lot of pain
That was new pleasure  the ideal
Dim vanities of dreams by night 
And dimmer nothings which were real 
Shadows  and a more shadowy light!
Parted upon their misty wings
And so confusedly became
Thine image and  a name  a name!
Two separate  yet most intimate things
I was ambitious  have you known
The passion father? You have not:
A cottager I markd a throne
Of half the world as all my own
And murmurd at such lowly lot 
But just like any other dream
Upon the vapor of the dew
My own had past did not the beam
Of beauty which did while it thro
The minute  the hour  the day  oppress
My mind with double loveliness
We walkd together on the crown
Of a high mountain which lookd down
Afar from its proud natural towers
Of rock and forest on the hills 
The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
And shouting with a thousand rills
I spoke to her of power and pride
But mystically  in such guise
  
That she might deem it nought beside
The moments converse; in her eyes
I read perhaps too carelessly 
A mingled feeling with my own 
The flush on her bright cheek to me
Seemd to become a queenly throne
Too well that I should let it be
Light in the wilderness alone
I wrappd myself in grandeur then
And donnd a visionary crown 
Yet it was not that Fantasy
Had thrown her mantle over me 
But that among the rabble  men
Lion ambition is chaind down 
And crouches to a keepers hand 
Not so in deserts where the grand 
The wild  the terrible conspire
With their own breath to fan his fire
Look round thee now on Samarcand! 
Is she not queen of Earth? her pride
Above all cities? in her hand
Their destinies? in all beside
Of glory which the world hath known
Stands she not nobly and alone?
Falling  her veriest steppingstone
Shall form the pedestal of a throne 
And who her sovereign? Timour  he
Whom the astonished people saw
Striding oer empires haughtily
A diademd outlaw!
O human love! thou spirit given
On Earth of all we hope in Heaven!
  
Which fallst into the soul like rain
Upon the Sirocwitherd plain
And failing in thy power to bless
But leavst the heart a wilderness!
Idea! which bindest life around
With music of so strange a sound
And beauty of so wild a birth 
Farewell! for I have won the Earth
When Hope the eagle that towerd could see
No cliff beyond him in the sky
His pinions were bent droopingly 
And homeward turnd his softend eye
T was sunset: when the sun will part
There comes a sullenness of heart
To him who still would look upon
The glory of the summer sun
That soul will hate the evning mist
So often lovely and will list
To the sound of the coming darkness known
To those whose spirits harken as one
Who in a dream of night would fly
But cannot from a danger nigh
What tho the moon  the white moon
Shed all the splendor of her noon
Her smile is chilly  and her beam
In that time of dreariness will seem
So like you gather in your breath
A portrait taken after death
And boyhood is a summer sun
Whose waning is the dreariest one 
  
For all we live to know is known
And all we seek to keep hath flown 
Let life then as the dayflower fall
With the noonday beauty  which is all
I reachd my home  my home no more 
For all had flown who made it so
I passd from out its mossy door
And tho my tread was soft and low
A voice came from the threshold stone
Of one whom I had earlier known 
O I defy thee Hell to show
On beds of fire that burn below
An humbler heart  a deeper wo
Father I firmly do believe 
I know  for Death who comes for me
From regions of the blest afar
Where there is nothing to deceive
Hath left his iron gate ajar
And rays of truth you cannot see
Are flashing thro Eternity
I do believe that Eblis hath
A snare in every human path 
Else how when in the holy grove
I wandered of the idol Love
Who daily scents his snowy wings
With incense of burnt offerings
From the most unpolluted things
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
Above with trellisd rays from Heaven
No mote may shun  no tiniest fly 
  
The lightning of his eagle eye 
How was it that Ambition crept
Unseen amid the revels there
Till growing bold he laughed and leapt
In the tangles of Loves very hair?
  


SCIENCE! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes
Why preyest thou thus upon the poets heart
Vulture whose wings are dull realities?
How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise
Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies
Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
To seek a shelter in some happier star?
Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood
The Elfin from the green grass and from me
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?
  

O! NOTHING earthly save the ray
Thrown back from flowers of Beautys eye
As in those gardens where the day
Springs from the gems of Circassy 
O! nothing earthly save the thrill
Of melody in woodland rill 
Or music of the passionhearted
Joys voice so peacefully departed
That like the murmur in the shell
Its echo dwelleth and will dwell 
Oh nothing of the dross of ours 
Yet all the beauty  all the flowers
That list our Love and deck our bowers 
Adorn yon world afar afar 
The wandering star
T was a sweet time for Nesace  for there
Her world lay lolling on the golden air
Near four bright suns  a temporary rest 
An oasis in desert of the blest
Away  away  mid seas of rays that roll
Empyrean splendor oer th unchained soul 
The soul that scarce the billows are so dense
Can struggle to its destind eminence 
  
To distant spheres from time to time she rode
And late to ours the favourd one of God 
But now the ruler of an anchord realm
She throws aside the sceptre  leaves the helm
And amid incense and high spiritual hymns
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs
Now happiest loveliest in yon lovely Earth
Whence sprang the Idea of Beauty into birth
Falling in wreaths thro many a startled star
Like womans hair mid pearls until afar
It lit on hills Achaian and there dwelt
She lookd into Infinity  and knelt
Rich clouds for canopies about her curled 
Fit emblems of the model of her world 
Seen but in beauty  not impeding sight
Of other beauty glittering thro the light 
A wreath that twined each starry form around
And all the opald air in color bound
All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
Of flowers: of lilies such as reard the head
On the fair Capo Deucato and sprang
So eagerly around about to hang
Upon the flying footsteps of  deep pride 
 Of her who lovd a mortal  and so died
The Sephalica budding with young bees
Upreard its purple stem around her knees:
And gemmy flower of Trebizond misnamd 
  
Inmate of highest stars where erst it shamd
All other loveliness: its honied dew
The fabled nectar that the heathen knew
Deliriously sweet was droppd from Heaven
And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
In Trebizond  and on a sunny flower
So like its own above that to this hour
It still remaineth torturing the bee
With madness and unwonted reverie:
In Heaven and all its environs the leaf
And blossom of the fairy plant in grief
Disconsolate linger  grief that hangs her head
Repenting follies that full long have fled
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air
Like guilty beauty chastend and more fair:
Nyctanthes too as sacred as the light
She fears to perfume perfuming the night:
And Clytia pondering between many a sun
While pettish tears adown her petals run:
And that aspiring flower that sprang on earth 
And died ere scarce exalted into birth
Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
Its way to Heaven from garden of a king:
  
And Valisnerian lotus thither flown
From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:
And thy most lovely purple perfume Zante!
Isola doro!  Fior di Levante!
And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever
With Indian Cupid down the holy river 
Fair flowers and fairy! to whose care is given
To bear the Goddess song in odors up to Heaven:
Spirit! that dwellest where
In the deep sky
The terrible and fair
In beauty vie!
Beyond the line of blue 
The boundary of the star
Which turneth at the view
Of thy barrier and thy bar 
Of the barrier overgone
By the comets who were cast
From their pride and from their throne
To be drudges till the last 
To be carriers of fire
The red fire of their heart
With speed that may not tire
And with pain that shall not part 
  
Who livest  that we know 
In Eternity  we feel 
But the shadow of whose brow
What spirit shall reveal?
Tho the beings whom thy Nesace
Thy messenger hath known
Have dreamd for thy Infinity
A model of their own 
Thy will is done Oh God!
The star hath ridden high
Thro many a tempest but she rode
Beneath thy burning eye;
And here in thought to thee 
In thought that can alone
  
Ascend thy empire and so be
A partner of thy throne 
 By winged Fantasy
My embassy is given
Till secrecy shall knowledge be
In the environs of Heaven
She ceasd  and buried then her burning cheek
Abashd amid the lilies there to seek
A shelter from the fervour of His eye;
For the stars trembled at the Deity
She stird not  breathd not  for a voice was there
How solemnly pervading the calm air!
A sound of silence on the startled ear
Which dreamy poets name the music of the sphere
Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call
Silence  which is the merest word of all
All Nature speaks and evn ideal things
Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings 
But ah! not so when thus in realms on high
The eternal voice of God is passing by
And the red winds are withering in the sky!
What tho in worlds which sightless cycles run
Linkd to a little system and one sun 
Where all my love is folly and the crowd
Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud
The storm the earthquake and the oceanwrath 
Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?
  
What tho in worlds which own a single sun
The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run
Yet thine is my resplendency so given
To bear my secrets thro the upper Heaven
Leave tenantless thy crystal home and fly
With all thy train athwart the moony sky 
Apart  like fireflies in Sicilian night
And wing to other worlds another light!
Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
To the proud orbs that twinkle  and so be
To evry heart a barrier and a ban
Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!
Up rose the maiden in the yellow night
The singlemoon�d eve!  on Earth we plight
Our faith to one love  and one moon adore 
The birthplace of young Beauty had no more
As sprang that yellow star from downy hours
Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers
And bent oer sheeny mountain and dim plain
Her way  but left not yet her Theras�an reign

HIGH on a mountain of enamelld head 
Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
Of giant pasturage lying at his ease
Raising his heavy eyelid starts and sees
  
With many a mutterd hope to be forgiven
What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven 
Of rosy head that towering far away
Into the sunlit ether caught the ray
Of sunken suns at eve  at noon of night
While the moon dancd with the fair stranger light 
Upreard upon such height arose a pile
Of gorgeous columns on th unburthend air
Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there
And nursled the young mountain in its lair
 Of molten stars their pavement such as fall
Thro the ebon air besilvering the pall
Of their own dissolution while they die 
Adorning then the dwellings of the sky
A dome by link�d light from Heaven let down
Sat gently on these columns as a crown 
A window of one circular diamond there
Lookd out above into the purple air
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
And hallowd all the beauty twice again
Save when between th Empyrean and that ring
Some eager spirit flappd his dusky wing
But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
The dimness of this world: that greyish green
That Nature loves the best for Beautys grave
Lurkd in each cornice round each architrave 
And every sculpturd cherub thereabout
That from his marble dwelling peer�d out
Seemd earthly in the shadow of his niche 
Achaian statues in a world so rich
  
Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis 
From Balbec and the stilly clear abyss
Of beautiful Gomorrah! O the wave
Is now upon thee  but too late to save!
Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
Witness the murmur of the grey twilight
That stole upon the ear in Eyraco
Of many a wild stargazer long ago 
That stealeth ever on the ear of him
Who musing gazeth on the distance dim
And sees the darkness coming as a cloud 
Is not its formits voice  most palpable and loud?
But what is this?  it cometh  and it brings
A music with it  t is the rush of wings 
  
A pause  and then a sweeping falling strain
And Nesace is in her halls again
From the wild energy of wanton haste
Her cheeks were flushing and her lips apart;
And zone that clung around her gentle waist
Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart
Within the centre of that hall to breathe
She pausd and panted Zanthe! all beneath
The fairy light that kissd her golden hair
And longd to rest yet could but sparkle there!
Young flowers were whispering in melody
To happy flowers that night  and tree to tree;
Fountains were gushing music as they fell
In many a starlit grove or moonlit dell;
Yet silence came upon material things 
Fair flowers bright waterfalls and angel wings 
And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:
Neath bluebell or streamer 
Or tufted wild spray
That keeps from the dreamer
The moonbeam away 
Bright beings! that ponder
With half closing eyes
  
On the stars which your wonder
Hath drawn from the skies
Till they glance thro the shade and
Come down to your brow
Like  eyes of the maiden
Who calls on you now 
Arise! from your dreaming
In violet bowers
To duty beseeming
These starlitten hours 
And shake from your tresses
Encumberd with dew
The breath of those kisses
That cumber them too 
O! how without you Love!
Could angels be blest?
Those kisses of true love
That lulld ye to rest!
Up!  shake from your wing
Each hindering thing:
The dew of the night 
It would weigh down your flight;
And true love caresses 
O! leave them apart!
They are light on the tresses
But lead on the heart
Ligeia! Ligeia!
My beautiful one!
Whose harshest idea
Will to melody run
O! is it thy will
On the breezes to toss?
  
Or capriciously still
Like the lone Albatross
Incumbent on night
As she on the air
To keep watch with delight
On the harmony there?
Ligeia! wherever
Thy image may be
No magic shall sever
Thy music from thee
Thou hast bound many eyes
In a dreamy sleep 
But the strains still arise
Which thy vigilance keep 
The sound of the rain
Which leaps down to the flower
And dances again
In the rhythm of the shower 
 The murmur that springs
From the growing of grass
Are the music of things 
But are modelld alas! 
Away then my dearest
O! hie thee away
To springs that lie clearest
Beneath the moonray 
To lone lake that smiles
In its dream of deep rest
  
At the many starisles
That enjewel its breast 
Where wild flowers creeping
Have mingled their shade
On its margin is sleeping
Full many a maid 
Some have left the cool glade and
Have slept with the bee 
Arouse then my maiden
On moorland and lea 
Go! breathe on their slumber
All softly in ear
The musical number
They slumberd to hear 
For what can awaken
An angel so soon
Whose sleep hath been taken
Beneath the cold moon
As the spell which no slumber
Of witchery may test
The rhythmical number
Which lulld him to rest?
Spirits in wing and angels to the view
A thousand seraphs burst th Empyrean thro
  
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight 
Seraphs in all but Knowledge the keen light
That fell refracted thro thy bounds afar
O Death! from eye of God upon that star:
Sweet was that error  sweeter still that death 
Sweet was that error  evn with us the breath
Of Science dims the mirror of our joy 
To them t were the Simoom and would destroy 
For what to them availeth it to know
That Truth is Falsehood  or that Bliss is Woe?
Sweet was their death  with them to die was rife
With the last ecstasy of satiate life 
Beyond that death no immortality 
But sleep that pondereth and is not to be 
And there  oh! may my weary spirit dwell 
Apart from Heavens Eternityand yet how far from Hell!
What guilty spirit in what shrubbery dim
Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
  
But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts
To those who hear not for their beating hearts
A maidenangel and her seraphlover 
O! where and ye may seek the wide skies over
Was Love the blind near sober Duty known?
Unguided Love hath fallen  mid tears of perfect moan
He was a goodly spirit  he who fell:
A wanderer by mossymantled well 
A gazer on the lights that shine above 
A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
What wonder? for each star is eyelike there
And looks so sweetly down on Beautys hair 
And they and evry mossy spring were holy
To his lovehaunted heart and melancholy
The night had found to him a night of wo
Upon a mountain crag young Angelo 
Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie
Here sate he with his love  his dark eye bent
With eagle gaze along the firmament:
Now turnd it upon her  but ever then
It trembled to the orb of EARTH again
Ianthe dearest see! how dim that ray!
How lovely t is to look so far away!
She seemd not thus upon that autumn eve
I left her gorgeous halls  nor mournd to leave
That eve  that eve  I should remember well 
The sunray droppd in Lemnos with a spell
On th Arabesque carving of a gilded hall
Wherein I sate and on the draperied wall 
  
And on my eyelids  O the heavy light!
How drowsily it weighd them into night!
On flowers before and mist and love they ran
With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
But O that light!  I slumberd  Death the while
Stole oer my senses in that lovely isle
So softly that no single silken hair
Awoke that slept  or knew that he was there
The last spot of Earths orb I trod upon
Was a proud temple calld the Parthenon 
More beauty clung around her columnd wall
Than evn thy glowing bosom beats withal
And when old Time my wing did disenthral
Thence sprang I  as the eagle from his tower
And years I left behind me in an hour
What time upon her airy bounds I hung
One half the garden of her globe was flung
Unrolling as a chart unto my view 
Tenantless cities of the desert too!
Ianthe beauty crowded on me then
And half I wishd to be again of men
My Angelo! and why of them to be?
A brighter dwellingplace is there for thee 
And greener fields than in yon world above
And womans loveliness  and passionate love
But list Ianthe! when the air so soft
Faild as my pennond spirit leapt aloft
Perhaps my brain grew dizzy  but the world
I left so late was into chaos hurld 
  
Sprang from her station on the winds apart
And rolld a flame the fiery Heaven athwart
Methought my sweet one then I ceased to soar
And fell  not swiftly as I rose before
But with a downward tremulous motion thro
Light brazen rays this golden star unto!
Nor long the measure of my falling hours
For nearest of all stars was thine to ours 
Dread star! that came amid a night of mirth
A red D�dalion on the timid Earth
We came  and to thy Earth  but not to us
Be given our ladys bidding to discuss:
We came my love; around above below
Gay firefly of the night we come and go
Nor ask a reason save the angelnod
She grants to us as granted by her God 
But Angelo than thine grey Time unfurld
Never his fairy wing oer fairier world!
Dim was its little disk and angel eyes
Alone could see the phantom in the skies
When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
Headlong thitherward oer the starry sea
But when its glory swelld upon the sky
As glowing Beautys bust beneath mans eye
We pausd before the heritage of men
And thy star trembled  as doth Beauty then!
Thus in discourse the lovers whiled away
The night that waned and waned and brought no day
They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts
Who hear not for the beating of their hearts
  


ROMANCE who loves to nod and sing
With drowsy head and folded wing
Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake
To me a painted paroquet
Hath been  a most familiar bird 
Taught me my alphabet to say 
To lisp my very earliest word
While in the wild wood I did lie
A child  with a most knowing eye
Of late eternal Condor years
So shake the very Heaven on high
With tumult as they thunder by
I have no time for idle cares
Through gazing on the unquiet sky
And when an hour with calmer wings
Its down upon my spirit flings 
That little time with lyre and rhyme
To while away  forbidden things!
My heart would feel to be a crime
Unless it trembled with the strings
  


I SAW thee on thy bridal day 
When a burning blush came oer thee
Though happiness around thee lay
The world all love before thee:
And in thine eye a kindling light
Whatever it might be
Was all on Earth my aching sight
Of Loveliness could see
That blush perhaps was maiden shame 
As such it well may pass 
Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
In the breast of him alas!
Who saw thee on that bridal day
When that deep blush would come oer thee
Though happiness around thee lay
The world all love before thee
  

OH! that my young life were a lasting dream!
My spirit not awakening till the beam
Of an Eternity should bring the morrow
Yes! tho that long dream were of hopeless sorrow
T were better than the cold reality
Of waking life to him whose heart must be
And hath been still upon the lovely earth
A chaos of deep passion from his birth
But should it be  that dream eternally
Continuing  as dreams have been to me
In my young boyhood  should it thus be given
T were folly still to hope for higher Heaven
For I have revelld when the sun was bright
I the summer sky in dreams of living light
And loveliness  have left my very heart
Inclines of my imagining apart
From mine own home with beings that have been
Of mine own thought  what more could I have seen?
T was once  and only once  and the wild hour
From my remembrance shall not pass  some power
Or spell had bound me  t was the chilly wind
Came oer me in the night and left behind
Its image on my spirit  or the moon
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
Too coldly  or the stars  howeer it was
That dream was as that nightwind  let it pass
I have been happy tho in a dream
I have been happy  and I love the theme:
  
Dreams! in their vivid colouring of life
As in that fleeting shadowy misty strife
Of semblance with reality which brings
To the delirious eye more lovely things
Of Paradise and Love  and all our own!
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known
  

THY soul shall find itself alone
Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone 
Not one of all the crowd to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy:

Be silent in that solitude
Which is not loneliness  for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
In life before thee are again
In death around thee  and their will
Shall overshadow thee: be still

The night  tho clear  shall frown 
And the stars shall look not down
From their high thrones in the heaven
With light like Hope to mortals given 
But their red orbs without beam
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee for ever

Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish 
Now are visions neer to vanish 
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more  like dewdrops from the grass
  

The breeze  the breath of God  is still 
And the mist upon the hill
Shadowy  shadowy  yet unbroken
Is a symbol and a token 
How it hangs upon the trees
A mystery of mysteries! 
  


T WAS noontide of summer
And midtime of night;
And stars in their orbits
Shone pale thro the light
Of the brighter cold moon
Mid planets her slaves
Herself in the Heavens
Her beam on the waves
I gazed awhile
On her cold smile;
Too cold  too cold for me 
There passd as a shroud
A fleecy cloud
And I turnd away to thee
Proud Evening Star
In thy glory afar
And dearer thy beam shall be;
For joy to my heart
Is the proud part
Thou bearest in Heaven at night
And more I admire
Thy distant fire
Than that colder lowly light
  



TAKE this kiss upon thy brow!
And in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow 
You are not wrong to deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if Hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream
I stand amid the roar
Of a surftormented shore
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand 
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep  while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?
  


How often we forget all time when lone
Admiring Natures universal throne;
Her woods  her wilds  her mountains  the intense
Reply of HERS to our intelligence! 

IN youth have I known one with whom the Earth
In secret communing held  as he with it
In daylight and in beauty from his birth:
Whose fervid flickering torch of life was lit
From the sun and stars whence he had drawn forth
A passionate light  such for his spirit was fit 
And yet that spirit knew not in the hour
Of its own fervour what had oer it power

Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
To a ferver by the moonbeam that hangs oer
But I will half believe that wild light fraught
With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
Hath ever told  or is it of a thought
The unembodied essence and no more
That with a quickening spell doth oer us pass
As dew of the nighttime oer the summer grass?
  

Doth oer us pass when as th expanding eye
To the loved object  so the tear to the lid
Will start which lately slept in apathy?
And yet it need not be  that object hid
From us in life  but common  which doth lie
Each hour before us  but then only bid
With a strange sound as of a harpstring broken
To awake us  T is a symbol and a token

Of what in other worlds shall be  and given
In beauty by our God to those alone
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
Drawn by their hearts passion and that tone
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
Tho not with Faith  with godliness  whose throne
With desperate energy t hath beaten down;
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown
  


IN visions of the dark night
I have dreamed of joy departed 
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me brokenhearted
Ah! what is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past?
That holy dream  that holy dream
While all the world were chiding
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding
What though that light thro storm and night
So trembled from afar 
What could there be more purely bright
In Truths daystar?
  


THE happiest day  the happiest hour
My seard and blighted heart hath known
The highest hope of pride and power
I feel hath flown
Of power! said I? yes! such I ween;
But they have vanishd long alas!
The visions of my youth have been 
But let them pass
And pride what have I now with thee?
Another brow may even inherit
The venom thou hast pourd on me 
Be still my spirit!
The happiest day  the happiest hour
Mine eyes shall see  have ever seen
The brightest glance of pride and power
I feel  have been:
But were that hope of pride and power
Now offerd with the pain
Even then I felt  that brightest hour
I would not live again:
For on its wing was dark alloy
And as it flutterd  fell
An essence  powerful to destroy
A soul that knew it well
  

To 
IN youths spring it was my lot
To haunt of the wide world a spot
The which I could not love the less
So lovely was the loneliness
Of a wild lake with black rock bound
And the tall pines that towerd around 
But when the night had thrown her pall
Upon that spot as upon all
And the ghastly wind went by
In a dirgelike melody
Then  ah then I would awake
To the terror of that lone lake
Yet that terror was not fright
But a tremulous delight 
A feeling not the jewelld mine
Could teach or bribe me to define
Nor love  although the love were thine
Death was in that poisond wave
And in its depth a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his lone imagining 
Whose solitary soul could make
An Eden of that dim lake
  


THE bowers whereat in dreams I see
The wantonest singing birds
Are lips  and all thy melody
Of lipbegotten words 
Thine eyes in Heaven of heart enshrined
Then desolately fall
O God! on my funeral mind
Like starlight on a pall 
Thy heart  thy heart!  I wake and sigh
And sleep to dream till day
Of the truth that gold can never buy 
Of the baubles that it may
  

FAIR river! in thy bright clear flow
Of crystal wandering water
Thou art an emblem of the glow
Of beauty  the unhidden heart 
The playful maziness of art
In old Albertos daughter;
But when within thy wave she looks 
Which glistens then and trembles 
Why then the prettiest of brooks
Her worshipper resembles;
For in his heart as in thy stream
Her image deeply lies 
His heart which trembles at the beam
Of her soulsearching eyes
  


I HEED not that my earthly lot
Hath  little of Earth in it 
That years of love have been forgot
In the hatred of a minute: 
I mourn not that the desolate
Are happier sweet than I
But that you sorrow for my fate
Who am a passer by
  


DIM vales  and shadowy floods 
And cloudylooking woods
Whose forms we cant discover
For the tears that drip all over
Huge moons there wax and wane 
Again  again  again 
Every moment of the night 
Forever changing places 
And they put out the starlight
With the breath from their pale faces
About twelve by the moondial
One more filmy than the rest
A kind which upon trial
They have found to be the best
Comes down  still down  and down
With its centre on the crown
Of a mountains eminence
While its wide circumference
In easy drapery falls
Over hamlets over halls
Wherever they may be 
Oer the strange woods  oer the sea 
Over spirits on the wing 
Over every drowsy thing 
And buries them up quite
In a labyrinth of light 
And then how deep!  O deep!
Is the passion of their sleep
  
In the morning they arise
And their moony covering
Is soaring in the skies
With the tempests as they toss
Like  almost any thing 
Or a yellow Albatross
They use that moon no more
For the same end as before 
Videlicet a tent 
Which I think extravagant:
Its atomies however
Into a shower dissever
Of which those butterflies
Of Earth who seek the skies
And so come down again
Nevercontented things!
Have brought a specimen
Upon their quivering wings
  


HELEN thy beauty is to me
Like those Nic�an barks of yore
That gently oer a perfumed sea
The weary wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore
On desperate seas long wont to roam
Thy hyacinth hair thy classic face
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was Greece
And the grandeur that was Rome
Lo! in yon brilliant windowniche
How statuelike I see thee stand
The agate lamp within thy hand!
Ah Psyche from the regions which
Are HolyLand!
  


FROM childhoods hour I have not been
As others were  I have not seen
As others saw  I could not bring
My passions from a common spring 
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow  I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone 
And all I lovd  I lovd alone 
Then  in my childhood  in the dawn
Of a most stormy life  was drawn
From evry depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still 
From the torrent or the fountain 
From the red cliff of the mountain 
From the sun that round me rolld
In its autumn tint of gold 
From the lightning in the sky
As it passd me flying by 
From the thunder and the storm 
And the cloud that took the form
When the rest of Heaven was blue
Of a demon in my view 
  


HARK echo!  Hark; echo!
T is the sound
Of archangels in happiness wrapt
  


ELIZBETH  it surely is most fit
Logic and common usage so commanding
In thy own book that first thy name be writ
Zeno  and other sages notwithstanding;
And I have other reasons for so doing
Besides my innate love of contradiction;
Each poet  if a poet  in persuing
The muses thro their bowers of Truth or Fiction
Has studied very little of his part
Read nothing written less  in short s a fool
Endued with neither soul nor sense nor art
Being ignorant of one important rule
Employed in even the theses of the school 
Called  I forget the heathenish Greek name 
Called anything its meaning is the same
Always write first things uppermost in the heart
  

ELIZABETH it is in vain you say
Love not  thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L E L
Zantippes talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise
Breathe it less gently forth  and veil thine eyes
Endymion recollect when Luna tried
To cure his love  was cured of all beside 
His folly  pride  and passion  for he died
  

WHEN melancholy and alone
I sit on some mosscovered stone
Beside a murmring stream;
I think I hear thy voices sound
In every tuneful thing around
Oh! what a pleasant dream
The silvery streamlet gurgling on
The mockbird chirping on the thorn
Remind me love of thee
They seem to whisper thoughts of love
As thou didst when the stars above
Witnessed thy vows to me; 
The gentle zephyr floating by
In chorus to my pensive sigh
Recalls the hour of bliss
When from thy balmy lips I drew
Fragrance as sweet as Hermias dew
And left the first fond kiss
In such an hour when are forgot
The world its cares and my own lot
Thou seemest then to be
A gentle guarding spirit given
To guide my wandering thoughts to heaven
If they should stray from thee
  


THE great man lives forever shrined in the hearts of men
Albeit form and feature may fade from human ken;
Recorded are his actions on historys living  
They shine with purer lustre with each successive age
Immortal aye immortal undying as a God
The sands of time are printed wherever his feet have trod
Above his dust no monument may proudly rear its head
To mark the spot where resteth the mighty and the dead
He needeth no mausoleum nor shaft need pierce the sky
To point to coming ages where his sacred ashes lie
No! that may be forgotten but around his glorious name
Will shine the dazzling halo of a never dying fame
His requiem will be chanted in the wild birds sweetest song
The summer breeze and wintry gale the sad notes will prolong
The flowers of spring time and the leaves of autumn be his pall
Long as the one shall blossom long as the other fall
Here is a noble lesson Oh! let it graven be
In characters unfading on the  of memory
Like the needle to the mariner amidst the tempest wrath
Let it fire your hopes and guide you as you tread lifes thorny path
  



As turns the eye to bless the hand that led its infant years
As listning still for that sweet voice which every tone endears
So I to thee through mental power would each remembrance trace
And bless the hand that led me on to fonts of lasting grace
As sailor on the billowy deep hath seen some light afar
And shunned the rock that lies between his pathway and the star
So hast thou been oer stormy wave to me mid sorrows night
A beacon true whose glory spreads afar its rays of light
As flow sweet sounds of melody from strings drawn out by skill
As roll its wavelets oer the soul and all its chambers fill
So came the words of holy truth endued with wisdoms zeal
So fell their impress on my heart and stamped it with their seal
As runs the rivulet its course and swifter as it flows
Still murmuring of the hidden depths where first its waters rose
  
So evermore as life glides on expanding far and wide
Will turn the heart to where at first was oped its holiest tide
As pours the captive bird its song to him who sets it free
So flows my breath in song of praise in gratitude to thee
As oer the earth the sun reflects its rays of living light
So thou by thy pure rays of thought art power to mental sight
  


FIRST find out a word that doth silence proclaim
And that backwards and forwards is always the same;
Then next you must find out a feminine name
That backwards and forwards is always the same;
An act or a writing on parchment whose name
Both backwards and forwards is always the same;
A fruit that is rare whose botanical name
Read backwards and forwards is always the same;
A note used in music which time doth proclaim
And backwards and forwards is always the same;
Their initials connected a title will frame
That is justly the due of the fair married dame
Which backwards and forwards is always the same
  

WHEN from your gems of thought I turn
To those pure orbs your heart to learn
I scarce know what to prize most high 
The bright idea or bright deareye

WHO is king but Epiphanes?
Say  do you know?
Who is king but Epiphanes?
Bravo  bravo!
There is none but Epiphanes
No  there is none:
So tear down the temples
And put out the sun!
Who is king but Epiphanes?
Say  do you know?
Who is king but Epiphanes?
Bravo  bravo!

A THOUSAND a thousand a thousand
A thousand a thousand a thousand
We with one warrior have slain!
A thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand
Sing a thousand over again!
Soho!  let us sing
Long life to our king
Who knocked over a thousand so fine!
Soho!  let us roar
He has given us more
Red gallons of gore
Than all Syria can furnish of wine!
  

LO! one is on the mountain side
While the clouds are passing by 
With their black wings flapping heavily
Like eagles in the sky;
Or lying up in the forest trees
And waiting there for the mountainbreeze
And now he passes through the clouds 
And up to the mountaintop
Nor yet to look for the joyous sun
Does the hasty traveller stop
But he leapeth down in the broken path
With a step as light and free 
As ever in his days of mirth
In the dance and revelry
Why endeth he his hasty speed?
Why stoppeth on his way?
In truth it is a fearful thing
For human tongue to say
He fears that toward him pointeth there
A fleshless human hand;
Where the mountain rains have swept away
Its covering of sand;
  
That hand his very soul doth stir
For it proveth him a murderer
Ay long ago on the mountain side
The fearful deed was done;
And the murderer thought him safe that none
Could see save the broad bright sun
As he rolled in the heavens the dead above
And flooded the earth with his rays of love
Now lifted he his clouded eye
To the mountain crests behind;
And oer them came the broad black clouds
Upheaving with the wind;
And on them their thick darkness spread 
A crown upon the mountains head
And then shone out the flaming sun
From the waters of the sea;
And Gods own bow came in the clouds
And looked out gloriously;
But its colours were of wo and wrath
That threw their light oer the murderers path
And now Gods chariots  the clouds
Came rolling down with might;
Their wheels like many horsemen were
In battle or in flight
And yet no power to move hath he
His soul is in an agony
Over the murderer and dead
They rolled their mighty host;
  
Old oceans waves come not so thick
By northern tempests tost
Forth from their mighty bosom came
A flash of heavens wrath
And away the heavy clouds  and sun
Rolled from the murderpath
And the sun shone out where the murderer lay
Before the dead in the narrow way 
With his hand all seared and his breast torn bare 
Gods vengeance had been working there

THOU dark seastirring storm
Whence comest thou in thy might 
Nay  wait thou dim and dreamy form 
Storm spirit I call thee  t is mine of right 
Arrest thee in thy troubled flight
STORM SPIRIT
Thou askest me whence I came 
I came oer the sleeping sea
It roused at my torrent of storm and flame
And it howled aloud in its agony
And swelled to the sky  that sleeping sea
Thou askest me what I met 
A ship from the Indian shore
A tall proud ship with her sails all set 
Far down in the sea that ship I bore
My storms wild rushing wings before
And her men will forever lie
Below the unquiet sea;
And tears will dim full many an eye
  
Of those who shall widows and orphans be
And their days be years  for their misery
A boat with a starving crew 
For hunger they howled and swore;
While the blood from a fellows veins they drew
I came upon them with rush and roar 
Far under the waves that boat I bore
Two ships in a fearful fight 
When a hundred guns did flash
I came upon them  no time for flight 
But under the sea their timbers crash
And over their guns the wild waters dash
A wretch on a single plank 
And I tossed him on the shore 
A night and a day of the sea he drank
But the wearied wretch to the land I bore 
And now he walketh the earth once more 

Storm spirit  go on thy path 
The spirit has spread his wings 
And comes on the sea with a rush of wrath
As a war horse when he springs 
And over the earth his winds he flings 
And over the earth  nor stop nor stay 
The winds of the storm king go out on their way

GREEN and specked with spots of golden
Never since the ages olden 
Since the time of Cain and Abel
Never such a vegetable
So with odors sweetest laden
Thus our halls appearance made in
Who  oh! who in kindness sent thee
To afford my soul nepenthe?
Rude men seeing thee say Gosh!
T is a most enormous squash!
But the one who peers within
Knowledge of himself to win
Says while total silence reigns
Silence from the Stygian shore 
Grim silence darkling oer
This may perchance be but the skull
Of Arthur Cleveland Coxe so dull 
Its streaked yellow flesh  his brains


OH Times! Oh Manners! It is my opinion
That you are changing sadly your dominion 
I mean the reign of manners hath long ceased
For men have none at all or bad at least;
And as for times although t is said by many
The good old times were far the worst of any
Of which sound doctrine I believe each tittle
Yet still I think these worse than them a little
Ire been a thinking is nt that the phrase?
 I like your Yankee words and Yankee ways 
Ive been a thinking whether it were best
To take things seriously or all in jest;
Whether with Heraclitus of yore
To weep as he did till his eyes were sore
Or rather laugh with him that queer Philosopher
Democritus of Thrace who used to toss over
The  of life and grin at the dogears
As though hed say Why who the devil cares?
This is a question which Oh Heaven withdraw
The luckless query from a Members claw!
Instead of two sides Job has nearly eight
Each fit to furnish forth four hours debate
What shall be done? Ill lay it on the table
And take the matter up when I m more able
  
And in the meantime to prevent all bother
I ll neither laugh with one or cry with tother
Nor deal in flattery or aspersions foul
But taking one by each hand merely growl
Ah growl say you my friend and pray at what?
Why really sir I almost had forgot 
But damn it sir I deem it a disgrace
That things should stare us boldly in the face
And daily strut the street with bows and scrapes
Who would be men by imitating apes
I beg your pardon reader for the oath
The monkey made me swear though something loath;
I m apt to be discursive in my style
But pray be patient: yet a little while
Will change me and as politicians do
Ill mend my manners and my measures too
Of all the cities and Ive seen no few 
For I have travelled friend as well as you 
I dont remember one upon my soul
But take it generally upon the whole
As Members say they like their logic taken
Because divided it may chance be shaken
So pat agreeable and vastly proper
As this for a neat frisky counterhopper;
Here he may revel to his hearts content
Flounce like a fish in his own element
Toss back his fine curls from their forehead fair
And hop oer counters with a Vestris air
Complete at night what he began A M
And having cheated ladies dance with them;
  
For at a ball what fair one can escape
The pretty little hand that sold her tape
Or who so cold so callous to refuse
The youth who cut the ribbon for her shoes!
One of these fish par excellence the beau
God help me it has been my lot to know
At least by sight for I m a timid man
And always keep from laughing when I can;
But speak to him he ll make you such grimace
Lord! to be grave exceeds the power of face
The hearts of all the ladies are with him
Their bright eyes on his Tom and Jerry brim
And dovetailed coat obtained at cost; while then
Those wont turn on anything like men
His very voice is musical delight
His form once seen becomes a part of sight
In short his shirtcollar his look his tone is
The beau ideal fancied for Adonis
Philosophers have often held dispute
As to the seat of thought in man and brute
For that the power of thought attend the latter
My friend the beau hath made a settled matter
And spite all dogmas current in all ages
One settled fact is better than ten sages
For he does think although I m oft in doubt
If I can tell exactly what about
Ah yes! his little foot and ancle trim
T is there the seat of reason lies in him;
A wise philosopher would shake his head
He then of course must shake his foot instead
  
At me in vengeance shall that foot be shaken 
Another proof of thought Im not mistaken 
Because to his cats eyes I hold a glass
And let him see himself a proper ass?
I think he ll take this likeness to himself
But if he wont he shall the stupid elf
And lest the guessing throw the fool in fits
I close the portrait with the name of PITTS

Upreard upon such height arose a pile
Of gorgeous columns on th unburthened air 
* Flashing from Pariah marble that twinsmile
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there
And nursled the young mountain in its lair:
Of molten stars their pavement such as fall
Thro the ebon air  besilvering the pall
Of their own dissolution while they die 
Adorning then the dwellings of the sky;
A dome by linked light * from Heaven let down
Sat gently on these columns as a crown;
A window of one circular diamond there
  
Looked out above into the purple air
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
And hallowd all the beauty twice again
Save when between th Empyrean and that ring
Some eager spirit flappd a dusky wing:
But on the pillars seraph eyes have seen
The dimness of this world: that grayish green
That nature loves the best for Beautys grave
Lurked in each cornice  round each architrave 
And every sculpturd cherub thereabout
That from his marble dwelling ventured* out
Seemed earthly in the shadow of his niche 
Archaian statues in a world so rich?
Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis 
From Balbec and the stilly clear abyss
Of beautiful Gomorrah! oh! the wave
Is now upon thee  but too late to save!
Far down within the crystal of the lake
Thy swollen pillars tremble  and so quake
The hearts of many wanderers who look in
Thy luridness of beauty  and of sin
Another 

 Silence is the voice of God 
Ours is a world of words: quiet we call
Silence  which is the merest word of all
Here Nature speaks  and evn ideal things
Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings;
But ah! not so when in the realms on high
The eternal voice of God is moving by
And the red winds are withering in the sky!
From Tamerlane 

The feverd diadem on my brow
I claimed and won usurpingly:
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
Rome to the C�sar  this to me?
  
The heritage of a kingly mind
And a proud spirit which hath striven
Triumphantly with humankind
* * * *
On mountain soil I first drew life
The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews upon my head;
And I believe the winged strife
And tumult of the headlong air
Hath nestled in my very hair
* * * *
So late from Heaven that dew it fell
Mid dreams of one unholy night
Upon me with the touch of Hell 
While the red flashing of the light
From clouds that hung like banners oer
Seemd then to my halfclosing eye
The antry of monarchy;
And the deep trumpetthunders roar
Came hurriedly upon me telling
Of human battle near me swelling
* * * *
The rain came down upon my head
Unshelterd and the heavy wind
Was giantlike  so thou my mind!
It was but man I thought who shed
Laurels upon me  and the rush 
The torrent of the chilly air
Gurgled within my ear the crush
Of empires  with the captives prayer;
The hum of suitors and the tone
Of flattery round a sovereignthrone
* * * *
Young Loves first lesson is the heart:
For mid that sunshine and those smiles
When from our little cares apart
And laughing at her girlish wiles
Id throw me on her throbbing breast
And pour my spirit out in tears
  
There was no need to speak the rest 
No need to quiet any fears
Of her  who askd no reason why
But turned on me her quiet eye
Tamerlane dying 

Father! I firmly do believe 
I know  for Death who comes for me
From regions of the blest afar
Where there is nothing to deceive
Hath left his iron gate ajar;
And rays of truth you cannot see
Are flashing through Eternity 
I do believe that Eblis hath
A snare in every human path;
Else how when in the holy grove
I wandered of the idol Love
Who daily scents his snowy wings
With incense of burnt offerings
From the most undefiled things 
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
Above with trelliced rays from Heaven
No mote may shun  no tiniest fly
The lightning of his eagle eye
How was it that Ambition crept
Unseen amid the revels there
Till growing bold he laughd and leapt
In the tangles of Loves brilliant hair?
Passage from the minor poems

If my peace hath flown away
In a night  or in a day 
In a vision  or in none 
Is it therefore the less gone?
I am standing mid the roar
Of a weatherbeaten shore
And I hold within my hand
Some particles of sand 
  
How few! and how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep!
My early hopes?  No  they
Went gloriously away
Like lightning from the sky
At once  and so will I


Lo! Death hath reard himself a throne
In a strange city all alone
Far down within the dim west 
And the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest
There shrines and palaces and towers
Are  not like anything of ours 
O! no  O! no  ours never loom
To heaven with that ungodly gloom!
Timeeaten towers that tremble not!
Around by lifting winds forgot
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie
A heaven that God doth not contemn
With stars is like a diadem 
We liken our ladies eyes to them 
But there! That everlasting pall!
It would be mockery to call
Such dreariness a heaven at all
Yet tho no holy rays come down
On the long nighttime of that town
Light from the lurid deep sea
Streams up the turrets silently 
Up thrones  up longforgotten bowers
Of sculpturd ivy and stone flowers 
Up domes  up spires  up kingly halls 
Up fanes  up Babylonlike walls 
Up many a melancholy shrine
Whose entablatures intertwine
The mask  the viol  and the vine
There open temples  open graves
Are on a level with the waves 
But not the riches there that lie
In each idols diamond eye
  
Not the gaylyjewelld dead
Tempt the waters from their bed:
For no ripples curl alas!
Along that wilderness of glass 
No swellings hint that winds may be
Upon a faroff happier sea:
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air
While from the high towers of the town
Death looks gigantically down
But lo! a stir is in the air!
The wave! there is a ripple there!
As if the towers had thrown aside
In slightly sinking the dull tide 
As if the turrettops had given
A vacuum in the filmy heaven:
The waves have now a redder glow 
The very hours are breathing low 
And when amid no earthly moans
Down down that town shall settle hence
Hell rising from a thousand thrones
Shall do it reverence
And Death to some more happy clime
Shall give his undivided time
