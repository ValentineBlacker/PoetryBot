When somebody says the word �office� I think immediately of the cubicle: that charmless little box of efficiency a quality unconnected to sexuality in any way�one that is at least to my mind its opposite Which is perhaps the point As Julie Berebitsky points out in Sex and the Office: A History of Gender Power and Desire sexual relationships�consensual or not�have long been considered a threat to productivity and morale eclipsing the mid-century trope of the secretary sitting on the boss�s knee Employers labor to strip their offices of expressions of id encouraging their sublimation elsewhere She said �strip�! But all that this repression suggests is the persistence of what needed repressing in the first place
Women first started to take office jobs during the Civil War and their conspicuous presence prompted both desire and suspicion from men who were used to working only among themselves Lots of chasing leering and pinching ensued One idea from 1915 went so far as to suggest installing the stenographer in a wire cage At work some women met the man they would marry but many did not and a whole industry of advice-giving sprung up to serve the considerable number who found themselves in situations that were either untenable eg the extramarital affair or intolerable eg the lecherous boss
Berebitsky a professor of history at Sewanee cites several of these guidebooks noting that they unanimously agreed that �if a woman could not personally handle a man�s �strictly dishonorable� intentions she would have to quit� The onus was on her to muster all her superhuman powers to ignore the male libido: �She must learn not to see that his glance is too fervid not to feel that hand that rests on hers or the arm that slips around the back of the chair� counseled one guidebook though it also made clear that she couldn�t simply push the poor schlub�s hand away She should take care to treat him with �tact and politeness for it is not the rebuff that counts so much as the way in which it is done� This last point was key As one woman wrote anonymously in Harper�s in 1926 �the male of the species does not relish being made ridiculous�
The advice-giving even extended to a man�s wife at home who was told that she needn�t worry about those �sleek wily manicured creatures� prowling her husband�s office as long as she made sure to �pretty herself up love her man devotedly and believe in him� Men however were spared the exhortations and admonitions They didn�t need any advice because they were expected to satisfy their uncontrollable urges In the 1936 film Wife vs Secretary�one almost expects the poster to include crushed skyscrapers engulfed in flames and screaming people underfoot�there�s a scene in which a woman tells her mother-in-law that her husband has been cheating with the secretary and then the mother-in-law says something truly scary: �It�s horrible but you mustn�t be too hard on him � You wouldn�t blame a little boy for stealing a piece of candy if left in a room with a whole boxful�
Although she devotes only a few paragraphs to same-sex relationships Berbitsky otherwise makes thorough and thoughtful work of the material at hand showing how sex is never just about sex; it�s often about money too Any gains made by women in the workforce during the 1920s were swiftly undermined by the Depression when ambitious women�already suspect�were treated with naked hostility Women were advised to seek out positions in feminized occupations and told that in order to get a job and keep it they �would need to be impeccably feminine in attitude and appearance� Men fearful already for their jobs were looking not for competition but for subordinates A 1935 article in Fortune spelled out the advantages of striking the right gender balance in the office With �their conscious or subconscious intention some day to marry and their conscious or subconscious willingness to be directed by men� women made for �amenable and obedient� little workers
Unlike the factory or the farm where men�s virility was rarely in question the proliferation of office work aroused anxieties over manliness which was presumably sapped not only by the growing cloud of estrogen in the office but also by the stuff of office work itself�its soft sedentariness its pencil-pushing The gentleman valorized for most of the 19th century distinguished himself from the coarse lower classes by corralling his desires but the organization man of the mid-20th century was expected�even encouraged�to do the opposite if he were to escape utter emasculation Sex was a way for a man to assert the he was a man to keep in touch with his essential nature and protect it from the depleting effects of his job When in 1959 the journalist Edward R Murrow exposed how companies routinely hired prostitutes for clients and wrote the costs off as a business expense the scandalized public was nevertheless afforded a degree of relief As Berbitsky puts it �the sex-in-business scandal at least proved organization men were still men�
If sex was a lodestar for men making clear what it was that a real man should want and pursue sex�at least culturally�was more of a fitful variable for women who were given so many mixed messages about how to dress and behave that it�s a wonder they made it into the office at all They should make themselves attractive but not too attractive; available but not too available The stereotypes over the years vacillated between victim and vamp For the most part however the sexual woman was still presumed to be looking for love rather than professional advancement Then spake Helen Gurley Brown
When Sex and the Single Girl came out in 1962 Brown told women that sexuality could be a boon to business as well as love Rather than being an �unnatural penis-envying wolverine ready to spring at a man�s jugular vein� she wrote the professionally ambitious woman should find that �flirting and being seductive� would stimulate men to �give you better breaks�
This kind of advice was of course much more threatening to the accepted order of things It was one thing for a woman to be on the make for a man�s attention; it was another to be on the make for his job Writing in 1963 Philip Wylie warned of the �Sirens� who �must compete with and if necessary cripple manhood and masculinity on earth� It�s hard to know what kind of woman Wylie would have found bearable; in his book Generation of Vipers he also excoriated moms whom he likened to both Cinderella and Hitler But the increasing presence of women in more powerful positions meant that sex in the office would become even more disruptive than it was in the days of expendable stenographers at least from the employer�s point of view A more established professional presence also gave women a different sense of the kind of treatment they deserved
It wasn�t until 1975 that all the ogling and teasing and touching would get the name �sexual harassment� from feminists at Cornell allowing a problem that had long been considered a private predicament to become a social issue Still women who claimed they were sexually harassed have had to contend with endless suspicion�of their credibility of their motives of their senses of humor A sexual relationship deemed coercive by one side could be called consensual by the other As the lawyer and scholar Catharine MacKinnon said about one woman�s case in the mid-�80s �If you�re fucked you�re fucked� During the 1991 confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas his supporters tried to discredit Anita Hill by insinuating she was a crazy liar and/or an untrustworthy minx a defense tactic common enough that it goes by the name �nuts and sluts� Twenty years later Herman Cain brushed aside sexual harassment claims by dismissing one of his accusers as �a troubled woman� and it sometimes seems as if every new revelation gets mired in old rituals that have played themselves out many times before
All the changes in the law haven�t been matched by comparable changes in attitudes about gender about power about who wields that power and who is subject to it Men and women have periodically swapped the mantle of victim�women as economically vulnerable men as sexually vulnerable�but the general contours of the discussion have stayed the same Some legal scholars have tried to change that arguing that sexual harassment isn�t always about the sex but the idea hasn�t gotten much traction among the public at large whose interest is more reliably piqued when something sexual is involved Which allows other less salacious forms of power-mongering to go unnoticed or at least untalked about May we be forever disgusted by the noxiousness Anita Hill had to endure But we risk losing sight of the enormity of the problem as long as a pubic hair on a can of Coke is worth a thousand rounds of golf among the guys

For many years the main figure informing the ethics of my shopping habits was a handsome celebrity Paul Newman�s face�framed as it was by a variety of ethnic hats�signaled a quick opportunity to be a better person while just cruising down the condiment aisle When I chose Newman�s Own over its competitors I knew I was making the right split-second decision because Paul�s label declares �All profits to charity!� Which charity? Ill admit it: I never bothered to check�
When I accepted a job as lifestyle editor of this magazine last summer I knew it was time to think a little harder about the ethics of my day-to-day choices And soon I heard from dozens of PR representatives who said they could help They offered to send me $16 nail polish with sustainably harvested wood caps to support �organizations that help educate and sustain our beautiful planet� Fine chocolates produced in Madagascar that promised the cocoa farmers make �4x more income than fair trade cocoa alone� A wooden bristle hairbrush �handmade in Italy by native artisans� presumably to combat the nonartisanal production of hairbrushes�
�
In July a PR rep for a Brooklyn-based accessories company advanced the game The Andean Collection she explained was a �chic sustainable collection of accessories inspired by the rural Andes� founded by an American woman to �bring sustainable change to impoverished communities in Ecuador� That fall employees of the Collection would be traveling to the city of Otavalo to put the finishing touches on its line of jewelry hats and scarves Would I be interested in tagging along to document the process?�
�
Unlike Newman�s Own or say TOMS shoes which are instantly recognizable as �ethical� the Andean Collection is small It relies on journalists and buyers to relay its feel-good story Here�s how the company tells it: In 2008 Amanda Judge traveled to Otavalo to pen a master�s thesis on indigenous people�s experiences with rural poverty and how nonprofit and government groups could help But Judge soon realized that the best way to help these women was to get them jobs not give them grants Judge who had been interested in jewelry design since she was a kid drew from the artisans� �long history of creating jewelry out of rainforest seeds� and set about carving out a niche for it in the global market
�
Today the Andean Collection �continuously develops chic new designs inspired by the fusion of our urban surroundings in NYC and the natural beauty of Ecuador� and commissions artisans to construct them Seeds from rainforest palms are carefully carved dyed and polished into last season�s runway trends At upscale pseudo-bohemian boutiques and their shopping-mall counterparts like Chico�s and Anthropologie the pieces retail for $29 to $138 Each tag features a quote from the people who fashioned the beads: �Our life has been difficult but our children will have a better future thanks to the people like you who buy our jewelry��
�
I was skeptical that such a lopsided arrangement could truly be mutually beneficial But I was impressed that the Andean Collection was willing to invite a reporter along to poke around its story�s edges even in the form of a junket months later a GOOD editorial intern would tell me over beers on a Sunset Boulevard patio that I had acted unethically by going on the trip
�
�We are really excited� the PR representative told me when I accepted her offer �Do you have a planned article in mind or would this trip be more exploratory?��
�
The latter I replied While I�ve never found myself in a Chico�s comparing a string of Andean Collection beads to a comparable but less-ethically produced necklace maybe following these accessories to the source would help me make better decisions as a consumer In a sense I wanted to understand exactly what I�m getting when I reach for Paul Newman�s pasta sauce instead of Classico�to measure the gap between the status quo and the more ethical option

The story of ethical consumerism in the United States begins in 1946 with Edna Ruth Byler a Mennonite volunteer�the type of figure you might find staring out a window in a yellowing photo album hands in lap ankles crossed On a church trip to Puerto Rico the story goes Byler dropped in on a sewing class where she was struck by a new way to extend her charitable contributions She began buying the island�s lace needlework crafts and selling them to her friends back home in central Pennsylvania who found the doilies more appealing and exotic than the traditional charity ribbon Byler�s work spawned Ten Thousand Villages the first American craft supplier devoted to ethical global consumerism�
�
Ten Thousand Villages is still around selling Nepalese heart pendants and Indonesian carved wooden geckos to consumers who are thoughtful enough to seek them out But it�s been overshadowed by legions of big-namecompanies pushing their own ethical products Today socially conscious consumption is big business Making choices about how to live well is tough These companies tell us that we can do good by simply going about our days buying what we already want to buy Purchase Project RED-branded stuff� a Coca-Cola Nikes Belvedere vodka a Gap shirt�and �the shopper has a cool new T-shirt and has helped save a person�s life� Specifically the life of an African woman or child with HIV Sip a Starbucks coffee and �support fair wages for growers Buy Warby Parker eyeglasses and automatically donate a pair to someone in need �
�
Many of these products are stamped in shorthand: Sustainable Fair Trade Sweatshop-Free Buy One Give One A constellation of certifications�Fairtrade International the Fair Trade Federation the FTO Mark UTZ CERTIFIED Counter Culture Direct Trade Certification Whole Trade Guarantee B Corporation Green Seal�propose different standards for safe working conditions livable wages and environmental sustainability We�re assured that these companies have done the ethical legwork All we have to do is fasten the clasp�
�
No company has transcended such labels better than TOMS the shoe seller that hawks distressed canvas slip-ons silver-sequined ballet flats vegan knee-high wrap boots and now wedding footwear Each time we purchase a $54 pair of petal grosgrain flats �a child in need receives a pair of black slip-ons The contribution is so straightforward and wide reaching TOMS has donated more than a million pairs of shoes since 2006 that the brand has become its own ethical shorthand Consumers who want to buy better can pluck a pair of TOMS out of a sea of Urban Outfitters flats almost by muscle memory�
�
When you buy an Andean Collection bracelet you can�t quantify your contribution in charitable funds or matching handouts And to a certain extent the company wants to keep it that way On its website some Andean Collection products carry Fair Trade stamps but the company prefers�to convince consumers its processes are ethical by relaying a narrative about specific artisans workshops and supply chains�
�
Indeed the global economy is big and messy As TOMS says on its website ethical manufacturing is �a learning process� and TOMS is committed to making it transparent The company has published thumbnail photographs of some of the men and women who produce its shoes in Chinese Argentine and Ethiopian factories �Regular visits by our production staff and third party audits ensure not only that the product meets standards but that our factories provide a clean safe place to work fair wages and treatment and never employ underage labor� TOMS says The faq doesn�t address potential follow-up questions like �What constitutes a fair wage?� and �Where are the results of the audits?��
�
Kelsey Timmerman an American journalist who once traveled to China to interview the factory workers who make his Tevas recently began raising questions about TOMS� manufacturing practices TOMS fans rushed to the company�s defense Timmerman had not done his research they said �Get off your blog� they told him �Get inspired by something��
�
Nobody�s perfect Warby Parker�s �frames and their components are crafted in China� Last year Victoria�s Secret was criticized for claiming to sell fair trade bras and panties that were actually made from cotton harvested by child slaves In the story of modern ethical consumption we all tend to fast-forward to the good parts�
�
"What about the beginning of the story?"�Timmerman asks "Where the workers are?"

According to an Andean Collection tag tied delicately to a multicolored a�ai bead necklace the story begins on the outskirts of the sprawling market in Otavalo If you have anything to offer�grain Colgate a guinea pig a poncho a backpack with a glued-on patch of a Nintendo character�you carry it down to sell at one of the stalls in the labyrinthine market�
�
It�s here that Olga the woman who beaded this necklace once stood in a tiny stall selling grain That is until Amanda Judge crossed her path and plugged her into the global economy Now Olga and her husband Cesar for this piece the company has requested that I refer to them by first name only �for their privacy� lead an artisanal fair trade workshop They make jewelry that will be sold in one of 2000 locations around the world Olga also has a brick-and-mortar�shop in Otavalo where she sells her own jewelry designs; they are inspired by the Andean Collection which is in turn inspired by her region�s traditional crafts�
�
Olga met Judge three years ago when Judge dropped by Olga�s stall to interview her about her economic situation Judge recalls that she invited Olga up to her hotel room where Olga asked permission to sit on the bed It was her first time on a mattress �I don�t think I would want to sleep on a mattress� Olga told Judge Now that Olga has finally upgraded from a straw mat to a real bed she says: �I can�t believe I was sleeping on a floor that whole time��
�
Judge has a knack for delivering her company�s human-interest narrative in a wry tone that picks away at the sanctimony or sentimentality that might generally accompany such a story�imagine if Emma Stone spent her 20s learning the intricacies of the South American artisan economy Judge�s thin frame is always draped with handwoven scarves and strings of dyed beads her�long brown-red hair forever topped with an orange fedora or a sleek rabbit-fur hat Because the Andean Collection designs are pegged to the fashion cycle it has risen from the granola ranks of most fair-trade jewelry But it is still an accessories line for American women who catch up on trends about one season late�
�
Twice a year the Brooklyn- and Quito- based Andean Collection team descends on Otavalo to finalize its seasonal line check up on the artisans� welfare and broadcast on-the-ground updates back to potential customers It�s usually a whirlwind tour On this trip Judge and her employees�have hired a van to help them traverse the city�in the span of a week they must drop in on the handful of workshops where the Collection�s 70-plus artisans make hats weave scarves string beads and carve rings�
�

Olga�s home which doubles as her work- shop is an open-air brick structure on a hill When we arrive Olga is wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants directing the workers she�s hired to cook us lunch Her kids run through the house clutching fistfuls of fake money An enormous dog gnaws on a chicken foot in the yard Olga changes into her traditional garb�gold beads a white blouse a black skirt with bright embroidery around the waist�and circles the workshop answering questions about the requested tweaks she�s made to a half-dozen Chico�s prototypes�
�
Meanwhile Judge leads us on a tour of the home�s recent improvements�an Andean Collection tag brought to life This is Olga�s new refrigerator Here are her new stove new room new driveway new windowsills new courtyard new walls A new brick outhouse surrounds her first toilet which is also new Her nails are newly manicured Olga and Cesar join us unlock their new car with two beeps and drive us down the block We wade into their new field freshly planted with corn Olga and Cesar recently bought the land with the help of an Andean Collection loan; it will enable the artisans to diversify their income�
�
Olga begins answering questions into several voice recorders and cameras She doesn�t like talking about her past �My life before was really very sad� Olga says adding �Things are a lot better now� Olga credits the turn of events to God�and Amanda Judge�
�
Judge who is acting as translator deliberately mistranslates Olga�s praise directing it to �us� or �we� or �the Andean Collection� But Judge and Olga�s relationship is a direct one Judge is not giving away a million shoes to thousands of children; she is charting sustained progress in the lives of a few dozen artisans Whenever Judge returns to Otavalo Olga sits her at the head of the table brings her flowers and doesn�t let her help in the kitchen Cesar calls her Amandita �They bought me a live chicken once� Judge tells me later�
�
Standing in the field I ask Olga what she thinks of the American women who buy her jewelry Olga has been told a story about us too �They�re good people who want to help us� she tells me �People who like to help people and have good hearts��
�
Most people who buy the Andean Collection do like to help Suzette Munson runs Love 41 an online specialty boutique dedicated to charitable consumerism Typical product description: �HIV positive Ethiopian women left to die on a mountain are rescued and taught to make jewelry from melted down bullet shells� She has stocked the shop with more than a dozen Andean Collection designs �I especially love stories� Munson explains �Through the Andean Collection and these purchases the artisans have transformed their children�s lives and their own lives That�s very appealing to me��
�
Munson found the Andean Collection after �a lot of searching online� she says�She typed in �handmade� and �fair trade� and �jewelry� and began paging through the results Munson learns the stories behind everything she sells to assure customers their money is well spent�
�
Earlier that week the artisans sat for a PowerPoint presentation explaining�why a piece they would sell to the Andean Collection for $2 could be marked up to $22 by the time it hits the neck of the consumer pictured in the presentation as a smiling blonde woman on a city street�The presentation is meant to teach the artisans how to correctly price the items they sell to the Andean Collection and other international retailers to ensure they can cover the cost of the materials workshop overhead and minimum-wage paychecks for themselves and the apprentice artisans who work beneath them It sounds like the bare minimum but the Andean Collection is�actually going above and beyond Minimum wage and other labor laws in Ecuador are pretty much optional�
�
American ethics don�t always mesh well with developing-world economies We confront this firsthand after our visit with Olga when we walk up the hill to Kevin�s house The little stone structure looks the way Olga�s house looked before Kevin�s father works construction when there is construction work His mother�s only source of income is a cow When the Andean Collection arrived in Otavalo Kevin found a job threading beads in Olga�s workshop He was 11�
�
In order to ensure the country�s child labor laws don�t push the family deeper into poverty the Andean Collection pays Kevin a stipend not to work But Kevin�s mother is concerned: Spending all day at school instead of in the workshop Kevin is losing his skills �You can see why child labor does exist sometimes in some places� Judge tells me The Andean Collection is obligated under Ecuadorian law to refuse work to children under 15 though the regulations are lax �Obviously children working is not good but an entire family starving in my mind is a lot worse� Judge says�
�
The person who figures out how to deal with such quandaries is Chiara Gerlich the Andean Collection�s nonprofit and environmental resource manager When Judge goes home to Brooklyn Gerlich stays behind in Quito and investigates where the Andean Collection�s economic development efforts are causing unforeseen problems She makes sure workshops are paying their workers fairly points out sagging roofs for repair facilitates conflict resolution among the artisans helps administer small-business education classes and tries to help families like Kevin�s She traces stories back to the beginning�
�
Right now Gerlich is trying to get a handle on this tagua situation �TAGUA tahg-wah� the Andean Collection tag reads �This piece is handmade from tagua nut commonly known as �vegetable ivory� which grows from a palm tree in the lowlands of South America It is an eco-friendly material that requires little energy to process and its commercialization promotes forest growth��
�
Sometimes The Andean Collection makes efforts to trace its products from the artisans to the suppliers to the tree both to vouch for the quality of the materials �If you buy a bracelet from the market your wrist will turn purple� Judge tells me and to ensure that its products are truly sustainable But it can be difficult to lock down the supply chain �It�s assumed in Ecuador that all the seeds used are sustainably harvested that because it�s palm they just grow back��Gerlich says �But that�s actually not the case� Some suppliers will cut the trees more than once a year making it more and more difficult for the trees to regenerate The tagua harvesting business is competitive and suppliers can hold their territories and techniques very close to the vest It takes a lot of work to really know what you�re getting �

Amanda Judge is trying on an increasingly ridiculous series of hats�a floppy straw one; a version with loose frayed edges that dips down over the eyes; and one with a brim that explodes upward into a Chiquita Banana situation �That one is crazy� Judge decides But she�s serious about the middle one She�s seen a similar hat on the Anthropologie website priced in the hundreds �I think this would sell really well� she decides She�ll need samples right away for a catalog shoot in the Dominican Republic�
�
We�re in one of the company�s more established workshops�in addition to the Andean Collection�s line it produces Panama hats each one with a �Made in Ecuador� label sewn inside for other international companies When Judge arrives she kisses cheeks takes a tour of the workroom and is briefed on the production process�cutting molding ironing and ribboning the felt for a fedora Then Judge looks directly into another employee�s handheld video camera and expertly dictates the process back to it The videos will later be uploaded onto the Andean Collection website where a customer can get an inside look into how her Lola hat is made�
�

Down in the storeroom Judge twists her fingers around rabbit fur hats she�s considering for a limited-edition high-end line that�s in the works �I think the rich people would buy it in this style� she says placing one on her head �It�s going to be a ridiculously expensive hat��
�
Though Andean Collection customers are rich in Ecuadorian terms the target consumer rabbit fur line aside is a middleclass woman who usually picks up on fashion trends after they�ve trickled down from the runway and into the mainstream In the hat shop Andean Collection employees circulate a dog-eared copy of Vogue to demonstrate the brims and colors that are in�this season; the Andean Collection will catch up by the fall �If you�re on trend people are just going to buy more� Judge says�
�
The more they buy the more complicated the story gets Last year Anthropologie commissioned the Andean Collection to produce thousands of bright woven belts loosely inspired by Ecuador�s traditional waist-cinching fajas The Andean Collection partnered with a small belt-maker But when demand from buyers outpaced its looms it brought in a more established outfit to pick up the slack The company still works with small workshops but increasingly they aren�t enough�
�
The belts weren�t a hit with consumers Anthropologie later slashed the price of one style from $48 to $495 But abandoning its belt-makers would run counter to the Andean Collection�s mission So it transitioned them to producing �infinity scarves� loops of fabric made from the indigenous weavers� traditional materials acrylics The Collection�s designers mailed color swatches from Brooklyn to explain what �neon� meant Now weavers and designers are rushing to integrate �pops of neon� into a new crop of scarves before the catalog shoot The Andean Collection likes working with this workshop because �they�re really collaborative� Gerlich says �Not everybody wants to do that  Some people don�t want to change the designs don�t want to change colors��
�
Some might say that the production of neon infinity scarves is a perversion of traditional indigenous craftsmanship But Otavalen artisans have been producing and transporting designs for tourist tastes for the better part of a century long before fair trade practices hit the region The artisans I speak to are proud that their designs are being sold in New York and Paris and Japan if under the Andean Collection�s name�
�
But they aren�t sold in Otavalo When the Collection drops a new design on its artisans it has to make sure that it�s protected from the open market where it could be cheaply copied and devalued before it even appears in the Anthropologie catalog Once Judge walked into an internet caf� and saw a group of artisans scoping out her designs to make and sell for cheap in Otavalo�s market The competition there has grown fierce �It�s much harder now� says Rudi Colloredo-Mansfeld a University of North Carolina anthropology professor and an expert on Andean artisan economies �Every year there are more indigenous Otavale�os getting into this business� Prices have been driven down to the floor Artisans are forced to produce more and more pieces then sell them at prices that don�t even cover their costs�
�
* * *
Soon Judge may not be able to visit Olga every fashion cycle Judge is busy scouting a new location preparing to replicate this whole process in another needy economy It�s not yet clear how the companys story will adapt In each artisan community Judge will find different materials and styles different traditional crafts and different economic needs Each location will require a new narrative�
�
The Andean Collection has reached a turning point not just in Otavalo If the Collection continues to partner primarily with the neediest artisans its output will remain limited Bigger retailers like Anthropologie demand it produce more faster Scaling up means fewer Olgas will�
be elevated from grain pusher to jewelry designer Instead more established artisans will become a little bit more established
�
But it also means shoppers will be more likely to stumble across Andean Collection designs in the mall putting a more ethical option within reach of even people who arent reaching for it Who knows? Maybe in five years when an American woman sees an Andean Collection label she�ll immediately know what it stands for the way I instinctively react when I see Paul Newman�s smiling face on a bottle in the grocery store But no matter how many opportunities the market offers to align our ethics with our shopping habits the burden is still on us to resist the impulse to buy the cheapest closest thing Here at the top of the economic food chain no one will hold us accountable but ourselves�
�
On our last day in Otavalo Judge and I take a quick spin around the market for gifts to haul back home As we speed through stalls of earrings and table runners and alpaca sweaters artisans pitch lower and lower prices at our backs Judge has volunteered to help me haggle for a trio of woven purses I pay next to nothing for them Judge begins driving down the price of a knit onesie then decides not to push it�

�I think she can use the extra dollar more than I can� she says � ��
Andrew Pole had just started working as a statistician for Target in 2002 when two colleagues from the marketing department stopped by his desk to ask an odd question: �If we wanted to figure out if a customer is pregnant even if she didn�t want us to know can you do that? � 

 
Pole has a master�s degree in statistics and another in economics and has been obsessed with the intersection of data and human behavior most of his life His parents were teachers in North Dakota and while other kids were going to 4-H Pole was doing algebra and writing computer programs �The stereotype of a math nerd is true� he told me when I spoke with him last year �I kind of like going out and evangelizing analytics� 
As the marketers explained to Pole � and as Pole later explained to me back when we were still speaking and before Target told him to stop � new parents are a retailer�s holy grail Most shoppers don�t buy everything they need at one store Instead they buy groceries at the grocery store and toys at the toy store and they visit Target only when they need certain items they associate with Target � cleaning supplies say or new socks or a six-month supply of toilet paper But Target sells everything from milk to stuffed animals to lawn furniture to electronics so one of the company�s primary goals is convincing customers that the only store they need is Target But it�s a tough message to get across even with the most ingenious ad campaigns because once consumers� shopping habits are ingrained it�s incredibly difficult to change them 
There are however some brief periods in a person�s life when old routines fall apart and buying habits are suddenly in flux One of those moments � the moment really � is right around the birth of a child when parents are exhausted and overwhelmed and their shopping patterns and brand loyalties are up for grabs But as Target�s marketers explained to Pole timing is everything Because birth records are usually public the moment a couple have a new baby they are almost instantaneously barraged with offers and incentives and advertisements from all sorts of companies Which means that the key is to reach them earlier before any other retailers know a baby is on the way Specifically the marketers said they wanted to send specially designed ads to women in their second trimester which is when most expectant mothers begin buying all sorts of new things like prenatal vitamins and maternity clothing �Can you give us a list?� the marketers asked 
�We knew that if we could identify them in their second trimester there�s a good chance we could capture them for years� Pole told me �As soon as we get them buying diapers from us they�re going to start buying everything else too If you�re rushing through the store looking for bottles and you pass orange juice you�ll grab a carton Oh and there�s that new DVD I want Soon you�ll be buying cereal and paper towels from us and keep coming back� 
The desire to collect information on customers is not new for Target or any other large retailer of course For decades Target has collected vast amounts of data on every person who regularly walks into one of its stores Whenever possible Target assigns each shopper a unique code � known internally as the Guest ID number � that keeps tabs on everything they buy �If you use a credit card or a coupon or fill out a survey or mail in a refund or call the customer help line or open an e-mail we�ve sent you or visit our Web site we�ll record it and link it to your Guest ID� Pole said �We want to know everything we can� 
Also linked to your Guest ID is demographic information like your age whether you are married and have kids which part of town you live in how long it takes you to drive to the store your estimated salary whether you�ve moved recently what credit cards you carry in your wallet and what Web sites you visit Target can buy data about your ethnicity job history the magazines you read if you�ve ever declared bankruptcy or got divorced the year you bought or lost your house where you went to college what kinds of topics you talk about online whether you prefer certain brands of coffee paper towels cereal or applesauce your political leanings reading habits charitable giving and the number of cars you own In a statement Target declined to identify what demographic information it collects or purchases All that information is meaningless however without someone to analyze and make sense of it That�s where Andrew Pole and the dozens of other members of Target�s Guest Marketing Analytics department come in 
Almost every major retailer from grocery chains to investment banks to the US Postal Service has a �predictive analytics� department devoted to understanding not just consumers� shopping habits but also their personal habits so as to more efficiently market to them �But Target has always been one of the smartest at this� says Eric Siegel a consultant and the chairman of a conference called Predictive Analytics World �We�re living through a golden age of behavioral research It�s amazing how much we can figure out about how people think now� 
The reason Target can snoop on our shopping habits is that over the past two decades the science of habit formation has become a major field of research in neurology and psychology departments at hundreds of major medical centers and universities as well as inside extremely well financed corporate labs �It�s like an arms race to hire statisticians nowadays� said Andreas Weigend the former chief scientist at Amazoncom �Mathematicians are suddenly sexy� As the ability to analyze data has grown more and more fine-grained the push to understand how daily habits influence our decisions has become one of the most exciting topics in clinical research even though most of us are hardly aware those patterns exist One study from Duke University estimated that habits rather than conscious decision-making shape 45 percent of the choices we make every day and recent discoveries have begun to change everything from the way we think about dieting to how doctors conceive treatments for anxiety depression and addictions 
This research is also transforming our understanding of how habits function across organizations and societies A football coach named Tony Dungy propelled one of the worst teams in the NFL to the Super Bowl by focusing on how his players habitually reacted to on-field cues Before he became Treasury secretary Paul O�Neill overhauled a stumbling conglomerate Alcoa and turned it into a top performer in the Dow Jones by relentlessly attacking one habit � a specific approach to worker safety � which in turn caused a companywide transformation The Obama campaign has hired a habit specialist as its �chief scientist� to figure out how to trigger new voting patterns among different constituencies 
Researchers have figured out how to stop people from habitually overeating and biting their nails They can explain why some of us automatically go for a jog every morning and are more productive at work while others oversleep and procrastinate There is a calculus it turns out for mastering our subconscious urges For companies like Target the exhaustive rendering of our conscious and unconscious patterns into data sets and algorithms has revolutionized what they know about us and therefore how precisely they can sell 
Inside the brain-and-cognitive-sciences department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are what to the casual observer look like dollhouse versions of surgical theaters There are rooms with tiny scalpels small drills and miniature saws Even the operating tables are petite as if prepared for 7-year-old surgeons Inside those shrunken OR�s neurologists cut into the skulls of anesthetized rats implanting tiny sensors that record the smallest changes in the activity of their brains 
An MIT neuroscientist named Ann Graybiel told me that she and her colleagues began exploring habits more than a decade ago by putting their wired rats into a T-shaped maze with chocolate at one end The maze was structured so that each animal was positioned behind a barrier that opened after a loud click The first time a rat was placed in the maze it would usually wander slowly up and down the center aisle after the barrier slid away sniffing in corners and scratching at walls It appeared to smell the chocolate but couldn�t figure out how to find it There was no discernible pattern in the rat�s meanderings and no indication it was working hard to find the treat 
The probes in the rats� heads however told a different story While each animal wandered through the maze its brain was working furiously Every time a rat sniffed the air or scratched a wall the neurosensors inside the animal�s head exploded with activity As the scientists repeated the experiment again and again the rats eventually stopped sniffing corners and making wrong turns and began to zip through the maze with more and more speed And within their brains something unexpected occurred: as each rat learned how to complete the maze more quickly its mental activity decreased As the path became more and more automatic � as it became a habit � the rats started thinking less and less 
This process in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine is called �chunking� There are dozens if not hundreds of behavioral chunks we rely on every day Some are simple: you automatically put toothpaste on your toothbrush before sticking it in your mouth Some like making the kids� lunch are a little more complex Still others are so complicated that it�s remarkable to realize that a habit could have emerged at all 
Take backing your car out of the driveway When you first learned to drive that act required a major dose of concentration and for good reason: it involves peering into the rearview and side mirrors and checking for obstacles putting your foot on the brake moving the gearshift into reverse removing your foot from the brake estimating the distance between the garage and the street while keeping the wheels aligned calculating how images in the mirrors translate into actual distances all while applying differing amounts of pressure to the gas pedal and brake 
Now you perform that series of actions every time you pull into the street without thinking very much Your brain has chunked large parts of it Left to its own devices the brain will try to make almost any repeated behavior into a habit because habits allow our minds to conserve effort But conserving mental energy is tricky because if our brains power down at the wrong moment we might fail to notice something important like a child riding her bike down the sidewalk or a speeding car coming down the street So we�ve devised a clever system to determine when to let a habit take over It�s something that happens whenever a chunk of behavior starts or ends � and it helps to explain why habits are so difficult to change once they�re formed despite our best intentions 
To understand this a little more clearly consider again the chocolate-seeking rats What Graybiel and her colleagues found was that as the ability to navigate the maze became habitual there were two spikes in the rats� brain activity � once at the beginning of the maze when the rat heard the click right before the barrier slid away and once at the end when the rat found the chocolate Those spikes show when the rats� brains were fully engaged and the dip in neural activity between the spikes showed when the habit took over From behind the partition the rat wasn�t sure what waited on the other side until it heard the click which it had come to associate with the maze Once it heard that sound it knew to use the �maze habit� and its brain activity decreased Then at the end of the routine when the reward appeared the brain shook itself awake again and the chocolate signaled to the rat that this particular habit was worth remembering and the neurological pathway was carved that much deeper 
The process within our brains that creates habits is a three-step loop First there is a cue a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use Then there is the routine which can be physical or mental or emotional Finally there is a reward which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future Over time this loop � cue routine reward; cue routine reward � becomes more and more automatic The cue and reward become neurologically intertwined until a sense of craving emerges What�s unique about cues and rewards however is how subtle they can be Neurological studies like the ones in Graybiel�s lab have revealed that some cues span just milliseconds And rewards can range from the obvious like the sugar rush that a morning doughnut habit provides to the infinitesimal like the barely noticeable � but measurable � sense of relief the brain experiences after successfully navigating the driveway Most cues and rewards in fact happen so quickly and are so slight that we are hardly aware of them at all But our neural systems notice and use them to build automatic behaviors 
Habits aren�t destiny � they can be ignored changed or replaced But it�s also true that once the loop is established and a habit emerges your brain stops fully participating in decision-making So unless you deliberately fight a habit � unless you find new cues and rewards � the old pattern will unfold automatically 
�We�ve done experiments where we trained rats to run down a maze until it was a habit and then we extinguished the habit by changing the placement of the reward� Graybiel told me �Then one day we�ll put the reward in the old place and put in the rat and by golly the old habit will re-emerge right away Habits never really disappear� 
Luckily simply understanding how habits work makes them easier to control Take for instance a series of studies conducted a few years ago at Columbia University and the University of Alberta Researchers wanted to understand how exercise habits emerge In one project 256 members of a health-insurance plan were invited to classes stressing the importance of exercise Half the participants received an extra lesson on the theories of habit formation the structure of the habit loop and were asked to identify cues and rewards that might help them develop exercise routines 
The results were dramatic Over the next four months those participants who deliberately identified cues and rewards spent twice as much time exercising as their peers Other studies have yielded similar results According to another recent paper if you want to start running in the morning it�s essential that you choose a simple cue like always putting on your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed and a clear reward like a midday treat or even the sense of accomplishment that comes from ritually recording your miles in a log book After a while your brain will start anticipating that reward � craving the treat or the feeling of accomplishment � and there will be a measurable neurological impulse to lace up your jogging shoes each morning 
Our relationship to e-mail operates on the same principle When a computer chimes or a smartphone vibrates with a new message the brain starts anticipating the neurological �pleasure� even if we don�t recognize it as such that clicking on the e-mail and reading it provides That expectation if unsatisfied can build until you find yourself moved to distraction by the thought of an e-mail sitting there unread � even if you know rationally it�s most likely not important On the other hand once you remove the cue by disabling the buzzing of your phone or the chiming of your computer the craving is never triggered and you�ll find over time that you�re able to work productively for long stretches without checking your in-box 
Some of the most ambitious habit experiments have been conducted by corporate America To understand why executives are so entranced by this science consider how one of the world�s largest companies Procter & Gamble used habit insights to turn a failing product into one of its biggest sellers P& G is the corporate behemoth behind a whole range of products from Downy fabric softener to Bounty paper towels to Duracell batteries and dozens of other household brands In the mid-1990s P& G�s executives began a secret project to create a new product that could eradicate bad smells P& G spent millions developing a colorless cheap-to-manufacture liquid that could be sprayed on a smoky blouse stinky couch old jacket or stained car interior and make it odorless In order to market the product � Febreze � the company formed a team that included a former Wall Street mathematician named Drake Stimson and habit specialists whose job was to make sure the television commercials which they tested in Phoenix Salt Lake City and Boise Idaho accentuated the product�s cues and rewards just right 
The first ad showed a woman complaining about the smoking section of a restaurant Whenever she eats there she says her jacket smells like smoke A friend tells her that if she uses Febreze it will eliminate the odor The cue in the ad is clear: the harsh smell of cigarette smoke The reward: odor eliminated from clothes The second ad featured a woman worrying about her dog Sophie who always sits on the couch �Sophie will always smell like Sophie� she says but with Febreze �now my furniture doesn�t have to� The ads were put in heavy rotation Then the marketers sat back anticipating how they would spend their bonuses A week passed Then two A month Two months Sales started small and got smaller Febreze was a dud 
The panicked marketing team canvassed consumers and conducted in-depth interviews to figure out what was going wrong Stimson recalled Their first inkling came when they visited a woman�s home outside Phoenix The house was clean and organized She was something of a neat freak the woman explained But when P& G�s scientists walked into her living room where her nine cats spent most of their time the scent was so overpowering that one of them gagged 
According to Stimson who led the Febreze team a researcher asked the woman �What do you do about the cat smell?� 
�It�s usually not a problem� she said 
�Do you smell it now?� 
�No� she said �Isn�t it wonderful? They hardly smell at all!� 
A similar scene played out in dozens of other smelly homes The reason Febreze wasn�t selling the marketers realized was that people couldn�t detect most of the bad smells in their lives If you live with nine cats you become desensitized to their scents If you smoke cigarettes eventually you don�t smell smoke anymore Even the strongest odors fade with constant exposure That�s why Febreze was a failure The product�s cue � the bad smells that were supposed to trigger daily use � was hidden from the people who needed it the most And Febreze�s reward an odorless home was meaningless to someone who couldn�t smell offensive scents in the first place 
P& G employed a Harvard Business School professor to analyze Febreze�s ad campaigns They collected hours of footage of people cleaning their homes and watched tape after tape looking for clues that might help them connect Febreze to people�s daily habits When that didn�t reveal anything they went into the field and conducted more interviews A breakthrough came when they visited a woman in a suburb near Scottsdale Ariz who was in her 40s with four children Her house was clean though not compulsively tidy and didn�t appear to have any odor problems; there were no pets or smokers To the surprise of everyone she loved Febreze 
�I use it every day� she said 
�What smells are you trying to get rid of?� a researcher asked 
�I don�t really use it for specific smells� the woman said �I use it for normal cleaning � a couple of sprays when I�m done in a room� 
The researchers followed her around as she tidied the house In the bedroom she made her bed tightened the sheet�s corners then sprayed the comforter with Febreze In the living room she vacuumed picked up the children�s shoes straightened the coffee table then sprayed Febreze on the freshly cleaned carpet 
�It�s nice you know?� she said �Spraying feels like a little minicelebration when I�m done with a room� At the rate she was going the team estimated she would empty a bottle of Febreze every two weeks 
When they got back to P& G�s headquarters the researchers watched their videotapes again Now they knew what to look for and saw their mistake in scene after scene Cleaning has its own habit loops that already exist In one video when a woman walked into a dirty room cue she started sweeping and picking up toys routine then she examined the room and smiled when she was done reward In another a woman scowled at her unmade bed cue proceeded to straighten the blankets and comforter routine and then sighed as she ran her hands over the freshly plumped pillows reward P& G had been trying to create a whole new habit with Febreze but what they really needed to do was piggyback on habit loops that were already in place The marketers needed to position Febreze as something that came at the end of the cleaning ritual the reward rather than as a whole new cleaning routine 
The company printed new ads showing open windows and gusts of fresh air More perfume was added to the Febreze formula so that instead of merely neutralizing odors the spray had its own distinct scent Television commercials were filmed of women having finished their cleaning routine using Febreze to spritz freshly made beds and just-laundered clothing Each ad was designed to appeal to the habit loop: when you see a freshly cleaned room cue pull out Febreze routine and enjoy a smell that says you�ve done a great job reward When you finish making a bed cue spritz Febreze routine and breathe a sweet contented sigh reward Febreze the ads implied was a pleasant treat not a reminder that your home stinks 
And so Febreze a product originally conceived as a revolutionary way to destroy odors became an air freshener used once things are already clean The Febreze revamp occurred in the summer of 1998 Within two months sales doubled A year later the product brought in $230 million Since then Febreze has spawned dozens of spinoffs � air fresheners candles and laundry detergents � that now account for sales of more than $1 billion a year Eventually P& G began mentioning to customers that in addition to smelling sweet Febreze can actually kill bad odors Today it�s one of the top-selling products in the world 
Andrew Pole was hired by Target to use the same kinds of insights into consumers� habits to expand Target�s sales His assignment was to analyze all the cue-routine-reward loops among shoppers and help the company figure out how to exploit them Much of his department�s work was straightforward: find the customers who have children and send them catalogs that feature toys before Christmas Look for shoppers who habitually purchase swimsuits in April and send them coupons for sunscreen in July and diet books in December But Pole�s most important assignment was to identify those unique moments in consumers� lives when their shopping habits become particularly flexible and the right advertisement or coupon would cause them to begin spending in new ways 
In the 1980s a team of researchers led by a UCLA professor named Alan Andreasen undertook a study of peoples� most mundane purchases like soap toothpaste trash bags and toilet paper They learned that most shoppers paid almost no attention to how they bought these products that the purchases occurred habitually without any complex decision-making Which meant it was hard for marketers despite their displays and coupons and product promotions to persuade shoppers to change 
But when some customers were going through a major life event like graduating from college or getting a new job or moving to a new town their shopping habits became flexible in ways that were both predictable and potential gold mines for retailers The study found that when someone marries he or she is more likely to start buying a new type of coffee When a couple move into a new house they�re more apt to purchase a different kind of cereal When they divorce there�s an increased chance they�ll start buying different brands of beer 
Consumers going through major life events often don�t notice or care that their shopping habits have shifted but retailers notice and they care quite a bit At those unique moments Andreasen wrote customers are �vulnerable to intervention by marketers� In other words a precisely timed advertisement sent to a recent divorcee or new homebuyer can change someone�s shopping patterns for years 
And among life events none are more important than the arrival of a baby At that moment new parents� habits are more flexible than at almost any other time in their adult lives If companies can identify pregnant shoppers they can earn millions 
The only problem is that identifying pregnant customers is harder than it sounds Target has a baby-shower registry and Pole started there observing how shopping habits changed as a woman approached her due date which women on the registry had willingly disclosed He ran test after test analyzing the data and before long some useful patterns emerged Lotions for example Lots of people buy lotion but one of Pole�s colleagues noticed that women on the baby registry were buying larger quantities of unscented lotion around the beginning of their second trimester Another analyst noted that sometime in the first 20 weeks pregnant women loaded up on supplements like calcium magnesium and zinc Many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and extra-big bags of cotton balls in addition to hand sanitizers and washcloths it signals they could be getting close to their delivery date 
As Pole�s computers crawled through the data he was able to identify about 25 products that when analyzed together allowed him to assign each shopper a �pregnancy prediction� score More important he could also estimate her due date to within a small window so Target could send coupons timed to very specific stages of her pregnancy 
One Target employee I spoke to provided a hypothetical example Take a fictional Target shopper named Jenny Ward who is 23 lives in Atlanta and in March bought cocoa-butter lotion a purse large enough to double as a diaper bag zinc and magnesium supplements and a bright blue rug There�s say an 87 percent chance that she�s pregnant and that her delivery date is sometime in late August What�s more because of the data attached to her Guest ID number Target knows how to trigger Jenny�s habits They know that if she receives a coupon via e-mail it will most likely cue her to buy online They know that if she receives an ad in the mail on Friday she frequently uses it on a weekend trip to the store And they know that if they reward her with a printed receipt that entitles her to a free cup of Starbucks coffee she�ll use it when she comes back again 
In the past that knowledge had limited value After all Jenny purchased only cleaning supplies at Target and there were only so many psychological buttons the company could push But now that she is pregnant everything is up for grabs In addition to triggering Jenny�s habits to buy more cleaning products they can also start including offers for an array of products some more obvious than others that a woman at her stage of pregnancy might need 
Pole applied his program to every regular female shopper in Target�s national database and soon had a list of tens of thousands of women who were most likely pregnant If they could entice those women or their husbands to visit Target and buy baby-related products the company�s cue-routine-reward calculators could kick in and start pushing them to buy groceries bathing suits toys and clothing as well When Pole shared his list with the marketers he said they were ecstatic Soon Pole was getting invited to meetings above his paygrade Eventually his paygrade went up 
At which point someone asked an important question: How are women going to react when they figure out how much Target knows? 
�If we send someone a catalog and say �Congratulations on your first child!� and they�ve never told us they�re pregnant that�s going to make some people uncomfortable� Pole told me �We are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws But even if you�re following the law you can do things where people get queasy� 
About a year after Pole created his pregnancy-prediction model a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter and he was angry according to an employee who participated in the conversation 
�My daughter got this in the mail!� he said �She�s still in high school and you�re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?� 
The manager didn�t have any idea what the man was talking about He looked at the mailer Sure enough it was addressed to the man�s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again 
On the phone though the father was somewhat abashed �I had a talk with my daughter� he said �It turns out there�s been some activities in my house I haven�t been completely aware of She�s due in August I owe you an apology� 
When I approached Target to discuss Pole�s work its representatives declined to speak with me �Our mission is to make Target the preferred shopping destination for our guests by delivering outstanding value continuous innovation and exceptional guest experience� the company wrote in a statement �We�ve developed a number of research tools that allow us to gain insights into trends and preferences within different demographic segments of our guest population� When I sent Target a complete summary of my reporting the reply was more terse: �Almost all of your statements contain inaccurate information and publishing them would be misleading to the public We do not intend to address each statement point by point� The company declined to identify what was inaccurate They did add however that Target �is in compliance with all federal and state laws including those related to protected health information� 
When I offered to fly to Target�s headquarters to discuss its concerns a spokeswoman e-mailed that no one would meet me When I flew out anyway I was told I was on a list of prohibited visitors �I�ve been instructed not to give you access and to ask you to leave� said a very nice security guard named Alex 
Using data to predict a woman�s pregnancy Target realized soon after Pole perfected his model could be a public-relations disaster So the question became: how could they get their advertisements into expectant mothers� hands without making it appear they were spying on them? How do you take advantage of someone�s habits without letting them know you�re studying their lives? 
Before I met Andrew Pole before I even decided to write a book about the science of habit formation I had another goal: I wanted to lose weight 
I had got into a bad habit of going to the cafeteria every afternoon and eating a chocolate-chip cookie which contributed to my gaining a few pounds Eight to be precise I put a Post-it note on my computer reading �NO MORE COOKIES� But every afternoon I managed to ignore that note wander to the cafeteria buy a cookie and eat it while chatting with colleagues Tomorrow I always promised myself I�ll muster the willpower to resist 
Tomorrow I ate another cookie 
When I started interviewing experts in habit formation I concluded each interview by asking what I should do The first step they said was to figure out my habit loop The routine was simple: every afternoon I walked to the cafeteria bought a cookie and ate it while chatting with friends 
Next came some less obvious questions: What was the cue? Hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? And what was the reward? The taste of the cookie itself? The temporary distraction from my work? The chance to socialize with colleagues? 
Rewards are powerful because they satisfy cravings but we�re often not conscious of the urges driving our habits in the first place So one day when I felt a cookie impulse I went outside and took a walk instead The next day I went to the cafeteria and bought a coffee The next I bought an apple and ate it while chatting with friends You get the idea I wanted to test different theories regarding what reward I was really craving Was it hunger? In which case the apple should have worked Was it the desire for a quick burst of energy? If so the coffee should suffice Or as turned out to be the answer was it that after several hours spent focused on work I wanted to socialize to make sure I was up to speed on office gossip and the cookie was just a convenient excuse? When I walked to a colleague�s desk and chatted for a few minutes it turned out my cookie urge was gone 
All that was left was identifying the cue 
Deciphering cues is hard however Our lives often contain too much information to figure out what is triggering a particular behavior Do you eat breakfast at a certain time because you�re hungry? Or because the morning news is on? Or because your kids have started eating? Experiments have shown that most cues fit into one of five categories: location time emotional state other people or the immediately preceding action So to figure out the cue for my cookie habit I wrote down five things the moment the urge hit: 
Where are you? Sitting at my desk 
What time is it? 3:36 pm 
What�s your emotional state? Bored 
Who else is around? No one 
What action preceded the urge? Answered an e-mail 
The next day I did the same thing And the next Pretty soon the cue was clear: I always felt an urge to snack around 3:30 
Once I figured out all the parts of the loop it seemed fairly easy to change my habit But the psychologists and neuroscientists warned me that for my new behavior to stick I needed to abide by the same principle that guided Procter & Gamble in selling Febreze: To shift the routine � to socialize rather than eat a cookie � I needed to piggyback on an existing habit So now every day around 3:30 I stand up look around the newsroom for someone to talk to spend 10 minutes gossiping then go back to my desk The cue and reward have stayed the same Only the routine has shifted It doesn�t feel like a decision any more than the MIT rats made a decision to run through the maze It�s now a habit I�ve lost 21 pounds since then 12 of them from changing my cookie ritual 
After Andrew Pole built his pregnancy-prediction model after he identified thousands of female shoppers who were most likely pregnant after someone pointed out that some of those women might be a little upset if they received an advertisement making it obvious Target was studying their reproductive status everyone decided to slow things down 
The marketing department conducted a few tests by choosing a small random sample of women from Pole�s list and mailing them combinations of advertisements to see how they reacted 
�We have the capacity to send every customer an ad booklet specifically designed for them that says �Here�s everything you bought last week and a coupon for it� � one Target executive told me �We do that for grocery products all the time� But for pregnant women Target�s goal was selling them baby items they didn�t even know they needed yet 
�With the pregnancy products though we learned that some women react badly� the executive said �Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy so the baby ads looked random We�d put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers We�d put a coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes That way it looked like all the products were chosen by chance 
�And we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks she hasn�t been spied on she�ll use the coupons She just assumes that everyone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs As long as we don�t spook her it works� 
In other words if Target piggybacked on existing habits � the same cues and rewards they already knew got customers to buy cleaning supplies or socks � then they could insert a new routine: buying baby products as well There�s a cue �Oh a coupon for something I need!� a routine �Buy! Buy! Buy!� and a reward �I can take that off my list� And once the shopper is inside the store Target will hit her with cues and rewards to entice her to purchase everything she normally buys somewhere else As long as Target camouflaged how much it knew as long as the habit felt familiar the new behavior took hold 
Soon after the new ad campaign began Target�s Mom and Baby sales exploded The company doesn�t break out figures for specific divisions but between 2002 � when Pole was hired � and 2010 Target�s revenues grew from $44 billion to $67 billion In 2005 the company�s president Gregg Steinhafel boasted to a room of investors about the company�s �heightened focus on items and categories that appeal to specific guest segments such as mom and baby� 
Pole was promoted He has been invited to speak at conferences �I never expected this would become such a big deal� he told me the last time we spoke 
A few weeks before this article went to press I flew to Minneapolis to try and speak to Andrew Pole one last time I hadn�t talked to him in more than a year Back when we were still friendly I mentioned that my wife was seven months pregnant We shop at Target I told him and had given the company our address so we could start receiving coupons in the mail As my wife�s pregnancy progressed I noticed a subtle upswing in the number of advertisements for diapers and baby clothes arriving at our house 
Pole didn�t answer my e-mails or phone calls when I visited Minneapolis I drove to his large home in a nice suburb but no one answered the door On my way back to the hotel I stopped at a Target to pick up some deodorant then also bought some T-shirts and a fancy hair gel On a whim I threw in some pacifiers to see how the computers would react Besides our baby is now 9 months old You can�t have too many pacifiers 
When I paid I didn�t receive any sudden deals on diapers or formula to my slight disappointment It made sense though: I was shopping in a city I never previously visited at 9:45 pm on a weeknight buying a random assortment of items I was using a corporate credit card and besides the pacifiers hadn�t purchased any of the things that a parent needs It was clear to Target�s computers that I was on a business trip Pole�s prediction calculator took one look at me ran the numbers and decided to bide its time Back home the offers would eventually come As Pole told me the last time we spoke: �Just wait We�ll be sending you coupons for things you want before you even know you want them� 
The scene is a mysterious one beguiling thrilling and if you didn�t know better perhaps even a bit menacing According to the time-enhanced version of the story it opens on an afternoon in the late fall of 1965 when without warning a number of identical dark-green vans suddenly appear and sweep out from a parking lot in downtown Madison Wisconsin One by one they drive swiftly out onto the city streets At first they huddle together as a convoy It takes them only a scant few minutes to reach the outskirts�Madison in the sixties was not very big a bureaucratic and academic omnium-gatherum of a Midwestern city about half the size of today There is then a brief halt some cursory consultation of maps and the cars begin to part ways
All of this first group of cars head off to the south As they part the riders wave their farewells whereupon each member of this curious small squadron officially commences his long outbound adventure�toward a clutch of carefully selected small towns some of them hundreds and even thousands of miles away These first few cars are bound to cities situated in the more obscure corners of Florida Oklahoma and Alabama Other cars that would follow later then went off to yet more cities and towns scattered evenly across every corner of every mainland state in America The scene as the cars leave Madison is dreamy and tinted with romance especially seen at the remove of nearly fifty years Certainly nothing about it would seem to have anything remotely to do with the thankless drudgery of lexicography
But it had everything to do with the business not of illicit love interstate crime or the secret movement of monies but of dictionary making For the cars which would become briefly famous at least in the somewhat fame-starved world of lexicography were the University of Wisconsin Word Wagons All were customized 1966 Dodge A100 Sportsman models purchased en masse with government grant money Equipped for long-haul journeying they were powered by the legendarily indestructible Chrysler Slant-Six 170-horsepower engine and appointed with modest domestic fixings that included a camp bed sink and stove Each also had two cumbersome reel-to-reel tape recorders and a large number of tape spools 
The drivers and passengers who manned the wagons were volunteers bent to one overarching task: that of collecting America�s other language They were being sent to more than a thousand cities towns villages and hamlets to discover and record before it became too late and everyone started to speak like everybody else the oral evidence of exactly what words and phrases Americans in those places spoke heard and read out in the boondocks and across the prairies down in the hollows and up on the ranges clear across the great beyond and in the not very long ago 
These volunteers were charged with their duties by someone who might at first blush seem utterly unsuitable for the task of examining American speech: a Briton born in Kingston of a Canadian father and a Jamaican mother: Frederic Gomes Cassidy a man whose reputation�he died twelve years ago aged ninety-two�is now about to be consolidated as one of the greatest lexicographers this country has ever known Cassidy�s standing�he is now widely regarded as this continent�s answer to James Murray the first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary; Cassidy was a longtime English professor at the University of Wisconsin while Murray�s chops were earned at Oxford�rests on one magnificent achievement: his creation of a monumental dictionary of American dialect speech conceived roughly half a century ago and over which he presided for most of his professional life 
The five-thousand-page five-volume book known formally as the Dictionary of American Regional English and colloquially just as DARE is now at last fully complete The first volume appeared in 1985: it listed tens of thousands of geographically specific dialect words from tall flowering plants known in the South as �Aaron�s Rod� to a kind of soup much favored in Wisconsin made from duck�s blood known as �czarina� The next two volumes appeared in the 1990s the fourth after 2000 so assiduously planned and organized by Cassidy as to be uninterrupted by his passing The fifth and final volume the culminating triumph of this extraordinary project is being published this March�it offers up regionalisms running alphabetically from �slab highway� as concrete-covered roads are apparently still known in Indiana and Missouri to �zydeco� not the music itself but a kind of raucous and high-energy musical party that is held in a long swathe of villages arcing from Galveston to Baton Rouge
�Aaron�s rod� to �zydeco��between these two verbal bookends lies an immense and largely hidden American vocabulary one that surely more than perhaps any other aspect of society reveals the wonderfully chaotic pluribus out of which two centuries of commerce and convention have forged the duller reality of the unum Which was precisely what Cassidy and his fellow editors sought to do�to capture before it faded away the linguistic coat of many colors of this immigrant-made country and to preserve it in snapshot in part for strictly academic purposes in part for the good of history and in part maybe on the off chance that the best of the lexicon might one day be revived 

The idea of creating a dictionary of regional dialect English was born across the Atlantic in England itself DARE�s fons et origo was the serial publication commenced in 1896 of the English Dialect Dictionary The hero in the story of this six-volume work now seldom seen but still revered by professional lexicographers is a little-remembered Yorkshireman named Joseph Wright a kindly bearded country-accented book collector who had fought his way out of utter poverty his father was a sometime wool weaver and quarryman from a Yorkshire hamlet inappositely named Idle to become a professor in comparative philology at Oxford
Wright who had studied German and mathematics before obtaining a PhD in philology came to believe that dialect just like its kissing cousin slang was a key component of any language as vital as English To preserve it to note it to promote and employ it was a noble project one that could help keep the mainstream language into which it often percolated flourishing and healthy It was to this end that he was set when a group called the English Dialect Society handed him�shortly after he had joined Oxford�s philology department�roughly a million yellowing paper slips weighing in all nearly a ton Each bore a dialect word or phrase that had been painstakingly gathered from Cornwall to the Shetlands by members of the tiny army of bespectacled and corduroyed enthusiasts who made up the Society
Professor Wright his mind unboggled by the scale swiftly resolved that he would likely need to accumulate a million more slips to forge the dictionary he had in mind But there was a problem: even in those more enlightened Victorian times when projects of monumental scale�like the OED and the Dictionary of National Biography�were begun without regard for cost no British publisher would agree to take this particular project on So Wright decided to assume responsibility for financing it himself For the next fourteen years he slaved singlemindedly with a team of assistants in a room provided by Clarendon Oxford�s press no doubt with in Oxford dialect his oak sported�his door shut firm 
He illustrated the hundred thousand headwords that he ultimately cobbled together from the slips and elsewhere in printed books�dialect words from the various regions of England from Scotland and Ireland and even some American words that had made their way ship-borne all the way back to Britain such as �to snub� an American-made reworking of the melancholy verb �to sob��with no fewer than half a million quotations filling five thousand printed pages in doing so It was a signal triumph of lexical dedication And to cap it all: on the day that his first volume was finally published Wright formally proposed marriage to a former student of his who had in later years become the project�s chief secretary Small wonder with such achievements to his name that he and Mrs Wright were widely declared the happiest couple in all of Oxford
The idea of making a fully formed dictionary of America�s various dialect words came soon after the EDD was finished in 1905 The American Dialect Society had been formed in 1889 and just as in Britain its enthusiasts had been wandering chatting listening reading�and capturing unfamiliar words and pinning them spatchcocked and anatomized onto index cards From time to time there were lists published in the ADS journal Dialect Notes but depressions and wars and the multiplicity of distractions to which even students of the lexicon are prey meant there was a somewhat haphazard catch-as-catch-can approach to collecting the vast panoply of dialect words with which time geography and a whole-world immigrant population had so amply gifted America
This clearly wasn�t good enough for the unrestrained ambition of Fred Cassidy After studying at Oberlin and the University of Michigan he had settled in Wisconsin playing the spider at the middle of the country�s linguistic web He had already displayed a fascination with American regionalisms publishing in 1947 a slim book on the place names around Madison where there were towns with names like Mazomanie Blue Mounds and Black Earth A questionnaire he had sent out in 1948 to thousands by mail from Madison asking about slang usage in the rural communities of Wisconsin was being seen as a model of its kind a signal success And by the late sixties he was well on the way to making a name for himself: consolidating his advancing reputation his Dictionary of Jamaican English with the etymologies of rather daring new words like �ganja� and �dreadlocks� and some thousands of others besides would be winning glowing reviews on its publication in 1967
In 1962 however Cassidy had begun to badger the ADS Could they not he asked and then kept on asking initiate a great dictionary project too a project that would do for America what the EDS had done for Britain? It took a while for his pleas to be answered but in 1963 the ADS leadership agreed And then in pondering how best to go about creating such a massive masterwork the Society came swiftly to confirm what Cassidy already suspected: that he Cassidy was the best possible candidate to spearhead the effort He had sufficient wood as the Jamaicans like to say to create the very dictionary which America so badly needed However it was far from an easy project to begin Aside from the lists published in the various pamphlets and journals of the ADS there was precious little material to use as fire starter Cassidy had no two-thousand-pound benison of yellowed word-slips bestowed upon him Most of the data for his great dictionary would have to be assembled anew But just like James Murray who famously worked under the OED�s guiding principle that to collect all English words all English writing had to be read Cassidy decided to think big To collect all American regional speech all American language had to be listened to and recorded and all American regions had to be visited Such a monumental work would take time people�and money 
But Cassidy was not a man to be daunted by such trivial problems Together with a colleague one of his students named Audrey Duckert he wrote a brand-new questionnaire for use out in the field; he received a grant from the US Office of Education to pay for a fleet of vans�the famous Word Wagons�that he deemed were necessary for visiting the farther-flung corners of the Republic; he worked out a battle plan and timetable for this immense gathering-in; and he calculated a system of subsistence payments for a team of some eighty volunteers graduate students and a few professors missionaries who shared his zeal for what he saw as a truly holy calling 
In the fall of 1965 he then formally set these teams to work a-hunting and a-gathering initially by waving them out of the parking lot in downtown Madison and from there onto the streets and back roads of the country What the teams would bring back over the following five years is a quite extraordinary record�a record that lays out the amazing wealth of a hitherto almost unknown American language 
Three improbably large numbers are critical to any appreciation of the linguistic component of the study and what it eventually accomplished: 1002 2777 and 1847 The Madison volunteers fanned out to 1002 carefully chosen communities selected for being generally stable old and variegated across the country There they interviewed and at length 2777 people�most of them middle-aged or older assumed thereby to have a greater familiarity with the lexical history of their communities and the greater proportion of them chosen for the same reason long-term residents And�though one may gasp at the impertinence the cheek the brass neck and the chutzpah of it all�the eighty youngsters who made the study presented each of these 2777 old-timers in the 1002 chosen communities with a list of no fewer than 1847 questions Three hundred twenty-five pages worth of interrogation�no census taker or pollster or focus-group leader of today could hardly hold a candle to the soldiers in Fred Cassidy�s dictionary army
With 1847 questions each interview would take as much as a week to complete�a testament perhaps to the lazier tempo of the times or else to the pertinacity of those whom Fred Cassidy selected to do his lexicographic heavy lifting Nearly a century before James Murray asked interested volunteer readers around the world to assist in the creation of the OED by jotting down what they read maybe one quote at a time Seventeen years later Joseph Wright had as many as six hundred volunteers occasionally noting words and expressions they heard in their communities Fred Cassidy on the other hand a taskmaster extraordinaire had all of his volunteers go out and ask questions on tape day after day after day and then transcribe the answers In addition to respondents� answers the volunteers also recorded most of them reading a famous all-the-phonemes-there-are test story called �Arthur the Rat� the results of which have been used for the past half century for the study of variations in regional accents The fieldwork was Herculean
Herculean that is in the performance of the lexical work alone One shouldn�t forget the nonlexical difficulties the fieldworkers might have encountered too This being the late sixties the time of Bobby Kennedy Martin Luther King My Lai and the Watts riots suspicion hostility and violence abounded�and not a few of the volunteers especially the shaggier-haired and more obviously intrusive and inquisitive were chased out of town threatened and even arrested accused of stirring things up and fomenting trouble

When seen in full Cassidy�s 325-page book of questions does not merely inspire awe It also has a kind of poetry about it the interrogations evidently made to blend lexical efficiency with literary elegance They run from simple temporal inquiries like Question A1�What do you call the time in the early morning before the sun comes into sight? to the fill-in-the-blank Question 0047b a query that relates improbably to the sweating of horses: They wouldn�t have caught cold if they hadn�t_____so much In between are all manner of word-inquiries Most are slyly innocent others are more blatantly invasive
What joking names do you have for an alarm clock? For a toothpick? For a container for kitchen scraps? Or an indoor toilet? Or women�s underwear? When a woman divides her hair into three strands and twists them together you say she is_____her hair? What words do you have to describe people�s legs if they�re noticeably bent or uneven or not right? What do you call the mark on the skin where somebody has sucked it hard and brought blood to the surface?
There are questions about the words used locally to describe loitering getting splinters sleeping late staring open-mouthed beating someone up Fred Cassidy and his team wanted to know all about health and sickness children�s games religion smoking and liquor entertainment emotional states friendship school-going exclamations What do you shout in these parts to drive away a dog a child a fly? different ways of saying �uptown� and �downtown� the names of the sounds that gas makes within a hungry person�s stomach and for the ruder noises made when it emerges from either end of the alimentary canal 
The inquiry seemed to cover every imaginable topic�love and marriage loose bowels gossips students fruit industrial plants insects flowers scolds�except that there appears to be in those more academically prudish times no sex whatsoever The names that were discovered around the nation for the giving of a vigorous kiss are to be found for sure; and the various names for a marriage hurriedly arranged because a child is on the way are listed by region also But as to what are the various names for the act that brought the child into being in the first place�of that Fred Cassidy�s questionnaire and so his eventual dictionary are memorably silent 

The Word Wagons went everywhere�from Blaine to Key West Eastport to San Diego and to inhabited Alaska even Those who undertook the odysseys interviewed all manner of what would be called �informants��the first on the immense eventual list each identified only by code being a sixty-one-year-old black maid in Jasper Alabama the 2777th a seventy-one-year old white �farm woman� in Cottage Grove Wisconsin All apparently sat patiently and tolerantly through the rigors of their questioning And though their names may be long kept secret their names of their hometowns when cached together make the purest poetry too: Tangier Virginia; Honey Brook Pennsylvania; Vevay Indiana; Snowflake Arizona: who could not but exult in this vast tapestry of difference seen even in the town names alone?
It took five years to compile the information and send it all back to Madison�the completed forms the annotated and transcribed tapes the spiral-backed field notebooks the punch cards into which the geographical statistical and frequency data were all siphoned using the University�s room-sized UNIVAC computer And then Cassidy and his staff of lexicographers�including the current chief editor Joan Hall who has lived with the project for most of her professional life�took over and got down to their allotted tasks
The work of these deskbound editors now became more Sisyphean than Herculean They started with letter �A� a point worth making since the OED�s Third Edition was actually started at the letter �M� �On to Z� soon became their watchword and was reportedly even engraved on Fred Cassidy�s tombstone These clever and dedicated worker-bees patiently drew on all the computer data they read and parsed the notebooks they consulted immense libraries of patois and vernacular and consulted scores of earlier dialect dictionaries and they then patiently and with scrupulous attention to detail listed in alphabetical order with headings for etymology orthography pronunciation and regional frequency and with illustrative quotations arranged by date all of the discovered dialect lexemes lemmae and phrases�recording in print such delights as �blueweed� �williwag� �Adam�s housecat� �podunk� �dropped egg� �baby carriage� �beau dollar� �blind pig� Any word offered with certainty by the informants�no matter how arcane it might have seemed�went in to the published vocabulary: �angledog� �bungalow apron� �brodie� �chagalag� all America�s topographically distinct and regionally generated words were duly recorded listed and entered 
They also drew clever maps adjusted for population Massachusetts thus being larger than Idaho New York almost the same size as California and on them plotted the geographical frequency of the more interesting discoveries�showing at a glance that it was people in the Appalachians who most commonly called an abscess a �bealing� for instance and how a bird a particularly pretty kind of swift was known as a �chimney sweep� more commonly in the Deep South than elsewhere 
And so they gathered and annotated all of these and in total some sixty thousand further lexical illustrations of just how varied and mismatched and chaotic this country truly is�or was at least half a century ago There is in truth little new or newly found in the dictionary: this is a deliberately fashioned portrait of the regional language of America as it was half a century ago�one small criticism that can fairly be leveled at a dictionary of the words of a vanished world that is now published for a modern world so much more accustomed to the immediate and the up to date
The completed dictionary memorializes an American language that is demarcated by geography topography heritage immigration In that sense it differs significantly from the many slang dictionaries which display a quite different but equally informal language that is denominated largely by craft by age by persuasion The language of thieves and computer geeks of carnival workers and sportsmen of drug addicts and prostitutes and the homosexual world is qualitatively different from the dialect words of those who have lived for years in the valleys of West Virginia say or the plains of South Dakota These two kinds of languages may occasionally overlap but they are by no means cut from the same cloth 
It is customary to suppose that it is the constant addition of slang to the mainstream of standard English that keeps American English so deliciously alive as a language�rendering it the most robust flexible and influential of all languages known The recent publication of two immense new slang lexicons�Jonathan Lighter�s half-completed Historical Dictionary of American Slang and Jonathon Green�s Dictionary of Slang�reinforces this notion reminding us of its truth Browsing through the thousands of pages of the slang dictionaries displays vividly�and in a way that browsing through DARE does not�just how much the informal cutting-edge vocabulary adds in great measure to the richness of what we speak and write today 
Not all slang words make it into the formal vocabulary of course�even after a century�s slang usage no New York Times reporter would write that �the cops� were investigating a crime But he would write and without fear of an editor�s objection that police were looking into charges that someone had �filched� a purse and that he later had stashed the �booty� in his room�in so writing employing two words that were once egregiously informal slang and yet are now made entirely acceptable to all 
Most slang is temporary and vanishes utterly Some large proportion remains employed as slang alone But a sufficient percentage still makes its way year upon year into the commonly written and read versions of English�a happenstance that makes its study and recording exciting and valuable a vital component of the joy of English By contrast the five volumes of DARE seem more like tombstones works of great scholarship and high purpose but at the same time a record of a language that is slowly being preserved in amber while dying out from under-use and fading away as with all the �withals� and �prithees� and �zounds� and �odds bodkins� of former times This does not render the five great books as being without purpose�they are read avidly by actors and acting coaches in Hollywood when making movies set in the Ozarks or ancient Idaho; lawyers swear by it as dreadful crimes have been solved by the forensic study of ransom notes DARE to hand; and literate cooks like to trace the origins of dishes from the names of spices and plant types recorded in these columns But all of such study and use is related to the English of yesterday�little of it is relevant to the use of English today and most certainly none of it has any significant resonance in the language that we are ever likely to employ tomorrow
Not too far away from Madison down in Hyde Park Illinois there have been recent celebrations for the completion of another similarly monumental project of lexicography The University of Chicago�s Assyrian Dictionary was begun in 1921 and was completed ninety years later It records in fine detail just how those in Mesopotamia wrote and read on clay tablets four thousand years ago The completion of the work in the winter of 2011 was greeted with much academic joy and with the exchanging of accolades and laurel wreaths 
And as with the Assyrian volumes so one might say not entirely unfairly with Fred Cassidy�s Dictionary of American Regional English A monument a memorial a piece of work both magisterial and majestic that someone somewhere was one day bound to undertake So to all who take pleasure from the complex mechanics of human communication: let us rejoice that someone did indeed undertake this gigantic task and recorded so fascinating a morsel of American linguistic history�and that they did so happily without anyone having the temerity to ask or to wonder at the reason why
Katy and I are on the same page about�socialite�Dara-Lynn Weiss awful "How I tortured my fat kid" essay in Aprils Vogue: Weiss does seem like a "nightmarish" mother and "her predicament would have an easier solution if society as a whole could just put the issue of weight in its place"�
But we disagree on where exactly that place should be�
Katy argued that parents ought to be able to have a frank conversation with their kids about weight as "a common health condition" The trouble is�we dont know for sure that Weiss daughter Beas weight was evidence of a health condition In fact the research is far from conclusive that weight causes health problems We know higher Body Mass Indexes tend to correlate with diabetes heart disease and so on But we also know that BMI can be a shockingly unreliable indicator of health: Consider the 71" 325 pound and with a BMI of 316�"obese" Shaquille ONeal Furthermore correlation is not causation Whether its the weight itself as in the literal pounds of fat on ones body�or the lifestyle habits namely lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet that causes the correlating health issues is subject to serious debate Adding to the confusion: At least�20 percent of obese people have no health issues at all and there are studies showing that�overweight women actually live longer than normal or underweight women�
Given all of this uncertainty why do we continue to focus all of our conversations about health on the bathroom scale? Because our culture has health all tangled up with beauty and self-worth We dive into cleanses take hot yoga or decide to ditch gluten and tell ourselves and anyone who asks or doesnt that were doing it for our health but 9 times out of 10 aesthetics are our true and more powerful motivator And we love to hate mothers like Dara-Lynn Weiss and Botox Mom and all those who have come before them because they make put the crazy so far out there its�easy to shake our heads at such Mommy Dearest ways � she screamed in Starbucks! She snuck cupcakes when Bea wasnt looking! � and conveniently avoid looking at all the ways were part of the same problem�
In fact when Weiss tells Bea "that fat girl is a thing of the past!" shes using the same "before body" rhetoric as any successful dieter ditching her fat jeans no matter how temporary the weight loss turns out to be But your body is always your body as Ive written before and as Bea knows: "Im not a different person because I lost sixteen pounds" she tells her mother "Just because its in the past doesnt mean it didnt happen"�
In order to put weight in its place we need to acknowledge that our obsession with it is fully about beauty and has almost nothing to do with health Then parents could have frank conversations with their kids � but they wouldnt be about weight or size Theyd be about eating well staying active and treating their bodies with love and respect�


You may not find it in a medical textbook but many young girls suffer from Princess Syndrome PS daily What is Princess Syndrome you ask? A girl who suffers from PS lives life as a fairy-tale: focusing only on the pretty things putting herself as the center of the universe and obsessing about her looks even if she�s only headed to the playground While this can be fun and whimsical when a girl is a toddler it can also set the tone for how she develops into a young woman influencing her self-esteem her dependence on others how she takes care of herself and how empowered she feels in her life
There are messages everywhere presented to girls that being a princess is the best and only way to be In today�s society with its focus on appearance having only the finest things and the need to be number one it is understandable that girls are having a difficult time deciphering the messages they observe
And why wouldn�t they? Clothing stores sell t-shirts that tell them they are �too pretty to do homework� Other stores sell thongs to 7-10-year-olds with slogans on them such as �wink wink� or �eye candy;� one has even started selling crotchless underwear for girls within this age range Abercrombie and Fitch a nationally known clothing company sold bikinis with push up tops in them designed for children as young as 5 How do young girls learn that they have worth beyond their appearance when the inordinate amount of pressure on them to �do this� or �look like that� begins so young? And while this pressure might have started as a teenager in the past current research shows that girls as young as 11 are having issues with their bodies


Parents often have the misconception that their daughters can avoid being affected by the messages they are receiving Unfortunately as well intentioned as this idea is it takes an incredible amount of self-confidence and self-awareness to avoid being seduced by these messages Advertising is incredibly powerful and impacts all of us at all ages Expecting your daughter at age 3 4 or 5 to understand that life is better if you have solid values good friends and a healthy lifestyle in comparison to the princess lifestyle is unrealistic It is up to you as a parent to combat the pressures coming from the outside
Of course it isn�t solely about appearance and impaired body image when considering Princess Syndrome It is also important to consider the other messages that your daughter gets from the fairy tale life she creates She may learn that she cannot be self-sufficient and that she has to rely on a savior to make it all better This can include friendships that are vapid and superficial boyfriends who get to dictate to her what she can and cannot do and a lack of internal motivation because she �expects� it all to come to her Being a princess has its place; being a princess who is empowered to create her kingdom herself? A much better option
So what can a parent do to help his/her daughter create her own happily ever after? Your first instinct may be to try to shield your daughter from all potentially negative influences Unfortunately this is virtually impossible Rather than avoid it teach her how to deal with the pressure and help her to develop positive self-esteem a realistic body-image and self-sufficiency
As a parent you can teach your daughter how to replace the unhealthy �princess symptoms� with positive �heroine values� By starting young you can set the stage for your daughter as she grows up But where to start?
The changes start with you As you become more aware of the messages in toys clothing and television shows you can begin to share them with your daughter and teach her things that will help her create a more positive empowered sense of herself Below are some skills to work on developing with your daughter It�s never too early to start
1 Question the media: Teach your daughter to be an educated consumer and to think about the messages she receives Start to help her formulate questions about the things she wants why she likes certain celebrities why appearance may be so important Help her to develop her own ideas about what it means to be strong independent and confident and to seek out similar things within the media
2 Teach her about dressing appropriately: Everywhere you turn clothes are getting skimpier and skimpier Skirts are getting shorter; tops are getting tighter Similarly clothes that used to be appropriate for teens are now being worn by fifth graders Start early teaching your daughter about the messages she sends by the clothes she wears You certainly are not going to get into a discussion with your five year old about what is sexy You may though talk about what might be more comfortable or easy to wear when playing with her friends and how much more fun she will have if she is comfortable This does not mean thwarting your daughter�s individuality and sense of style In fact it may mean promoting it Let her be mismatched She�s exploring who she is and having fun while doing it
3 Help her find her voice: Encourage your daughter to speak up and ask questions If she sees something she doesn�t like a doll or a shirt with a mixed message support her choice to talk with you about it If she comes to you with a concern make the time to talk with her All too often girls avoid speaking up for fear of damaging relationships they may have The more comfortable they feel talking with you about their feelings and the earlier this starts the more likely they will be able to do it as they develop into teens which is when you really want them talking with you
4 Remember: Conformity is not required: sometimes your daughter is going to want what other kids have just because they have it Giving in to this pressure is easy to do Help guide your daughter to understand that being an individual is good Encourage her to embrace her differences and even celebrate them! This will only help her as she grows up and develops a strong sense of herself her likes and dislikes and in how she determines what she will or will not do
Throughout your daughter�s development she will be pulled in lots of directions to act think and behave in certain ways As her parent it is important to use your influence to help direct her towards choosing things that will promote her ability to find her best self and fight the allure of the princess syndrome Getting her into some �princess recovery� might be the best way to help your daughter grow into the heroine you know she can be




THESE are thrilling days for behavioural research Every week seems to yield a new discovery about how bad people are at making decisions Humans it turns out are impressionable emotional and irrational We buy things we don�t need often at arbitrary prices and for silly reasons Studies show that when a store plays soothing music shoppers will linger for longer and often spend more If customers are in a good mood they are more susceptible to persuasion We believe price tends to indicate the value of things not the other way around And many people will squander valuable time to get something free
The sudden ubiquity of this research has rendered Homo economicus a straw man Yet such observations are not new Analysts have been studying modern man�s dumb instincts for ages Sigmund Freud argued that people are governed by irrational unconscious urges over a century ago And in America in the 1930s another Viennese psychologist named Ernest Dichter spun this insight into a million-dollar business His genius was in seeing the opportunity that irrational buying offered for smart selling
Recent years have seen an explosion of male joblessness and a steep decline in men�s life prospects that have disrupted the �romantic market� in ways that narrow a marriage-minded woman�s options: increasingly her choice is between deadbeats whose numbers are rising and playboys whose power is growing But this strange state of affairs also presents an opportunity: as the economy evolves it�s time to embrace new ideas about romance and family�and to acknowledge the end of �traditional� marriage as society�s highest ideal

In 2001 when I was 28 I broke up with my boyfriend Allan and I had been together for three years and there was no good reason to end things He was and remains an exceptional person intelligent good-looking loyal kind My friends many of whom were married or in marriage-track relationships were bewildered I was bewildered To account for my behavior all I had were two intangible yet undeniable convictions: something was missing; I wasn�t ready to settle down 
The period that followed was awful I barely ate for sobbing all the time A friend who suffered my company a lot that summer sent me a birthday text this past July: �A decade ago you and I were reuniting and you were crying a lot� I missed Allan desperately�his calm sure voice; the sweetly fastidious way he folded his shirts On good days I felt secure that I�d done the right thing Learning to be alone would make me a better person and eventually a better partner On bad days I feared I would be alone forever Had I made the biggest mistake of my life?

Ten years later I occasionally ask myself the same question Today I am 39 with too many ex-boyfriends to count and I am told two grim-seeming options to face down: either stay single or settle for a �good enough� mate At this point certainly falling in love and getting married may be less a matter of choice than a stroke of wild great luck A decade ago luck didn�t even cross my mind I�d been in love before and I�d be in love again This wasn�t hubris so much as na�vet�; I�d had serious long-term boyfriends since my freshman year of high school and simply couldn�t envision my life any differently 
Well there was a lot I didn�t know 10 years ago The decision to end a stable relationship for abstract rather than concrete reasons �something was missing� I see now is in keeping with a post-Boomer ideology that values emotional fulfillment above all else And the elevation of independence over coupling �I wasn�t ready to settle down� is a second-wave feminist idea I�d acquired from my mother who had embraced it in part I suspect to correct for her own choices 
I was her first and only recruit marching off to third grade in tiny green or blue T-shirts declaring: A Woman Without a Man Is Like a Fish Without a Bicycle or: A Woman�s Place Is in the House�and the Senate and bellowing along to Gloria Steinem & Co�s feminist-minded children�s album Free to Be � You and Me released the same year Title IX was passed also the year of my birth Marlo Thomas and Alan Alda�s retelling of �Atalanta� the ancient Greek myth about a fleet-footed princess who longs to travel the world before finding her prince became the theme song of my life Once in high school driving home from a family vacation my mother turned to my boyfriend and me cuddling in the backseat and said �Isn�t it time you two started seeing other people?� She adored Brian�he was invited on family vacations! But my future was to be one of limitless possibilities where getting married was something I�d do when I was ready to a man who was in every way my equal and she didn�t want me to get tied down just yet 
This unfettered future was the promise of my time and place I spent many a golden afternoon at my small New England liberal-arts college debating with friends the merits of leg-shaving and whether or not we�d take our husband�s surname Even then our concerns struck me as retro; hadn�t the women�s libbers tackled all this stuff already? We took for granted that we�d spend our 20s finding ourselves whatever that meant and save marriage for after we�d finished graduate school and launched our careers which of course would happen at the magical age of 30 
That we would marry and that there would always be men we wanted to marry we took on faith How could we not? One of the many ways in which our lives differed from our mothers� was in the variety of our interactions with the opposite sex Men were our classmates and colleagues our bosses and professors as well as in time our students and employees and subordinates�an entire universe of prospective friends boyfriends friends with benefits and even ex-boyfriends-turned-friends In this brave new world boundaries were fluid and roles constantly changing Allan and I had met when we worked together at a magazine in Boston full disclosure: this one where I was an assistant and he an editor; two years later he quit his job to follow me to New York so that I could go to graduate school and he could focus on his writing After the worst of our breakup we eventually found our way to a friendship so deep and sustaining that several years ago when he got engaged his fianc�e suggested that I help him buy his wedding suit As he and I toured through Manhattan�s men�s-wear ateliers we enjoyed explaining to the confused tailors and salesclerks that no no we weren�t getting married Isn�t life funny that way? 
I retell that moment as an aside as if it�s a tangent to the larger story but in a way it is the story In 1969 when my 25-year-old mother a college-educated high-school teacher married a handsome lawyer-to-be most women her age were doing more or less the same thing By the time she was in her mid-30s she was raising two small children and struggling to find a satisfying career She�d never had sex with anyone but my father Could she have even envisioned herself on a shopping excursion with an ex-lover never mind one who was getting married while she remained alone? And the ex-lover�s fianc�e being so generous and open-minded as to suggest the shopping trip to begin with? 
What my mother could envision was a future in which I made my own choices I don�t think either of us could have predicted what happens when you multiply that sense of agency by an entire generation 
But what transpired next lay well beyond the powers of everybody�s imagination: as women have climbed ever higher men have been falling behind We�ve arrived at the top of the staircase finally ready to start our lives only to discover a cavernous room at the tail end of a party most of the men gone already some having never shown up�and those who remain are leering by the cheese table or are you know the ones you don�t want to go out with 
In the 1990s Stephanie Coontz a social historian at Evergreen State College in Washington noticed an uptick in questions from reporters and audiences asking if the institution of marriage was falling apart She didn�t think it was and was struck by how everyone believed in some mythical Golden Age of Marriage and saw mounting divorce rates as evidence of the dissolution of this halcyon past She decided to write a book discrediting the notion and proving that the ways in which we think about and construct the legal union between a man and a woman have always been in flux 
What Coontz found was even more interesting than she�d originally expected In her fascinating Marriage a History: From Obedience to Intimacy or How Love Conquered Marriage she surveys 5000 years of human habits from our days as hunters and gatherers up until the present showing our social arrangements to be more complex and varied than could ever seem possible She�d long known that the Leave It to Beaver�style family model popular in the 1950s and �60s had been a flash in the pan and like a lot of historians she couldn�t understand how people had become so attached to an idea that had developed so late and been so short-lived 
For thousands of years marriage had been a primarily economic and political contract between two people negotiated and policed by their families church and community It took more than one person to make a farm or business thrive and so a potential mate�s skills resources thrift and industriousness were valued as highly as personality and attractiveness This held true for all classes In the American colonies wealthy merchants entrusted business matters to their landlocked wives while off at sea just as sailors vulnerable to the unpredictability of seasonal employment relied on their wives� steady income as domestics in elite households Two-income families were the norm 
Not until the 18th century did labor begin to be divided along a sharp line: wage-earning for the men and unpaid maintenance of household and children for the women Coontz notes that as recently as the late 17th century women�s contributions to the family economy were openly recognized and advice books urged husbands and wives to share domestic tasks But as labor became separated so did our spheres of experience�the marketplace versus the home�one founded on reason and action the other on compassion and comfort Not until the post-war gains of the 1950s however were a majority of American families able to actually afford living off a single breadwinner 
All of this was intriguing for sure�but even more surprising to Coontz was the realization that those alarmed reporters and audiences might be onto something Coontz still didn�t think that marriage was falling apart but she came to see that it was undergoing a transformation far more radical than anyone could have predicted and that our current attitudes and arrangements are without precedent �Today we are experiencing a historical revolution every bit as wrenching far-reaching and irreversible as the Industrial Revolution� she wrote 
Last summer I called Coontz to talk to her about this revolution �We are without a doubt in the midst of an extraordinary sea change� she told me �The transformation is momentous�immensely liberating and immensely scary When it comes to what people actually want and expect from marriage and relationships and how they organize their sexual and romantic lives all the old ways have broken down� 
For starters we keep putting marriage off In 1960 the median age of first marriage in the US was 23 for men and 20 for women; today it is 28 and 26 Today a smaller proportion of American women in their early 30s are married than at any other point since the 1950s if not earlier We�re also marrying less�with a significant degree of change taking place in just the past decade and a half In 1997 29 percent of my Gen X cohort was married; among today�s Millennials that figure has dropped to 22 percent Compare that with 1960 when more than half of those ages 18 to 29 had already tied the knot These numbers reflect major attitudinal shifts According to the Pew Research Center a full 44 percent of Millennials and 43 percent of Gen Xers think that marriage is becoming obsolete 
Even more momentously we no longer need husbands to have children nor do we have to have children if we don�t want to For those who want their own biological child and haven�t found the right man now is a good time to be alive Biological parenthood in a nuclear family need not be the be-all and end-all of womanhood�and in fact it increasingly is not Today 40 percent of children are born to single mothers This isn�t to say all of these women preferred that route but the fact that so many upper-middle-class women are choosing to travel it�and that gays and lesbians married or single and older women are also having children via adoption or in vitro fertilization�has helped shrink the stigma against single motherhood Even as single motherhood is no longer a disgrace motherhood itself is no longer compulsory Since 1976 the percentage of women in their early 40s who have not given birth has nearly doubled A childless single woman of a certain age is no longer automatically perceived as a barren spinster 
Of course between the diminishing external pressure to have children and the common misperception that our biology is ours to control some of us don�t deal with the matter in a timely fashion Like me for instance Do I want children? My answer is: I don�t know But somewhere along the way I decided to not let my biology dictate my romantic life If I find someone I really like being with and if he and I decide we want a child together and it�s too late for me to conceive naturally I�ll consider whatever technological aid is currently available or adopt and if he�s not open to adoption he�s not the kind of man I want to be with 
Do I realize that this further narrows my pool of prospects? Yes Just as I am fully aware that with each passing year I become less attractive to the men in my peer group who have plenty of younger more fertile women to pick from But what can I possibly do about that? Sure my stance here could be read as a feint or even self-deception By blithely deeming biology a nonissue I�m conveniently removing myself from arguably the most significant decision a woman has to make But that�s only if you regard motherhood as the defining feature of womanhood�and I happen not to 
Foremost among the reasons for all these changes in family structure are the gains of the women�s movement Over the past half century women have steadily gained on�and are in some ways surpassing�men in education and employment From 1970 seven years after the Equal Pay Act was passed to 2007 women�s earnings grew by 44 percent compared with 6 percent for men In 2008 women still earned just 77 cents to the male dollar�but that figure doesn�t account for the difference in hours worked or the fact that women tend to choose lower-paying fields like nursing or education A 2010 study of single childless urban workers between the ages of 22 and 30 found that the women actually earned 8 percent more than the men Women are also more likely than men to go to college: in 2010 55 percent of all college graduates ages 25 to 29 were female 

By themselves the cultural and technological advances that have made my stance on childbearing plausible would be enough to reshape our understanding of the modern family�but unfortunately they happen to be dovetailing with another set of developments that can be summed up as: the deterioration of the male condition As Hanna Rosin laid out in these pages last year �The End of Men� July/August 2010 men have been rapidly declining�in income in educational attainment and in future employment prospects�relative to women As of last year women held 514 percent of all managerial and professional positions up from 26 percent in 1980 Today women outnumber men not only in college but in graduate school; they earned 60 percent of all bachelor�s and master�s degrees awarded in 2010 and men are now more likely than women to hold only a high-school diploma 
No one has been hurt more by the arrival of the post-industrial economy than the stubbornly large pool of men without higher education An analysis by Michael Greenstone an economist at MIT reveals that after accounting for inflation male median wages have fallen by 32 percent since their peak in 1973 once you account for the men who have stopped working altogether The Great Recession accelerated this imbalance Nearly three-quarters of the 75 million jobs lost in the depths of the recession were lost by men making 2010 the first time in American history that women made up the majority of the workforce Men have since then regained a small portion of the positions they�d lost�but they remain in a deep hole and most of the jobs that are least likely ever to come back are in traditionally male-dominated sectors like manufacturing and construction 
The implications are extraordinary If in all sectors of society women are on the ascent and if gender parity is actually within reach this means that a marriage regime based on men�s overwhelming economic dominance may be passing into extinction As long as women were denied the financial and educational opportunities of men it behooved them to �marry up��how else would they improve their lot? As Maureen Dowd memorably put it in her 2005 book Are Men Necessary? �Females are still programmed to look for older men with resources while males are still programmed to look for younger women with adoring gazes� Now that we can pursue our own status and security and are therefore liberated from needing men the way we once did we are free to like them more or at least more idiosyncratically which is how love ought to be isn�t it? 
My friend B who is tall and gorgeous jokes that she could have married an NBA player but decided to go with the guy she can talk to all night�a graphic artist who comes up to her shoulder C the editorial force behind some of today�s most celebrated novels is a modern-day Venus de Milo�with a boyfriend 14 years her junior Then there are those women who choose to forgo men altogether Sonia Sotomayor isn�t merely a powerful woman in a black robe�she�s also a stellar example of what it can mean to exercise authority over every single aspect of your personal life When Gloria Steinem said in the 1970s �We�re becoming the men we wanted to marry� I doubt even she realized the prescience of her words 
But while the rise of women has been good for everyone the decline of males has obviously been bad news for men�and bad news for marriage For all the changes the institution has undergone American women as a whole have never been confronted with such a radically shrinking pool of what are traditionally considered to be �marriageable� men�those who are better educated and earn more than they do So women are now contending with what we might call the new scarcity Even as women have seen their range of options broaden in recent years�for instance expanding the kind of men it�s culturally acceptable to be with and making it okay not to marry at all�the new scarcity disrupts what economists call the �marriage market� in a way that in fact narrows the available choices making a good man harder to find than ever At the rate things are going the next generation�s pool of good men will be significantly smaller What does this portend for the future of the American family? 
Every so often society experiences a �crisis in gender� as some academics have called it that radically transforms the social landscape 
Take the years after the Civil War when America reeled from the loss of close to 620000 men the majority of them from the South An article published last year in The Journal of Southern History reported that in 1860 there were 104 marriageable white men for every 100 white women; in 1870 that number dropped to 875 A generation of Southern women found themselves facing a �marriage squeeze� They could no longer assume that they would become wives and mothers�a terrifying prospect in an era when women relied on marriage for social acceptability and financial resources 
Instead they were forced to ask themselves: Will I marry a man who has poor prospects �marrying down� in sociological parlance? Will I marry a man much older or much younger? Will I remain alone a spinster? Diaries and letters from the period reveal a populace fraught with insecurity As casualties mounted expectations dropped and women resigned themselves to lives without husbands or simply lowered their standards In 1862 a Confederate nurse named Ada Bacot described in her diary the lamentable fashion �of a woman marring a man younger than herself� Their fears were not unfounded�the mean age at first marriage did rise�but in time approximately 92 percent of these Southern-born white women found someone to partner with The anxious climate however as well as the extremely high levels of widowhood�nearly one-third of Southern white women over the age of 40 were widows in 1880�persisted 
Or take 1940s Russia which lost some 20 million men and 7 million women to World War II In order to replenish the population the state instituted an aggressive pro-natalist policy to support single mothers Mie Nakachi a historian at Hokkaido University in Japan has outlined its components: mothers were given generous subsidies and often put up in special sanatoria during pregnancy and childbirth; the state day-care system expanded to cover most children from infancy; and penalties were brandished for anyone who perpetuated the stigma against conceiving out of wedlock In 1944 a new Family Law was passed which essentially freed men from responsibility for illegitimate children; in effect the state took on the role of �husband� As a result of this policy�and of the general dearth of males�men moved at will from house to house where they were expected to do nothing and were treated like kings; a generation of children were raised without reliable fathers and women became the �responsible� gender This family pattern was felt for decades after the war 
Indeed Siberia today is suffering such an acute �man shortage� due in part to massive rates of alcoholism that both men and women have lobbied the Russian parliament to legalize polygamy In 2009 The Guardian cited Russian politicians� claims that polygamy would provide husbands for �10 million lonely women� In endorsing polygamy these women particularly those in remote rural areas without running water may be less concerned with loneliness than with something more pragmatic: help with the chores Caroline Humphrey a Cambridge University anthropologist who has studied the region said women supporters believed the legalization of polygamy would be a �godsend� giving them �rights to a man�s financial and physical support legitimacy for their children and rights to state benefits� 
Our own �crisis in gender� isn�t a literal imbalance�America as a whole currently enjoys a healthy population ratio of 508 percent females and 492 percent males But our shrinking pool of traditionally �marriageable� men is dramatically changing our social landscape and producing startling dynamics in the marriage market in ways that aren�t immediately apparent 

In their 1983 book Too Many Women? The Sex Ratio Question two psychologists developed what has become known as the Guttentag-Secord theory which holds that members of the gender in shorter supply are less dependent on their partners because they have a greater number of alternative relationships available to them; that is they have greater �dyadic power� than members of the sex in oversupply How this plays out however varies drastically between genders 
In societies where men heavily outnumber women�in what�s known as a �high-sex-ratio society��women are valued and treated with deference and respect and use their high dyadic power to create loving committed bonds with their partners and raise families Rates of illegitimacy and divorce are low Women�s traditional roles as mothers and homemakers are held in high esteem In such situations however men also use the power of their greater numbers to limit women�s economic and political strength and female literacy and labor-force participation drop 
One might hope that in low-sex-ratio societies�where women outnumber men�women would have the social and sexual advantage After all didn�t the mythical all-female nation of Amazons capture men and keep them as their sex slaves? But that�s not what happens: instead when confronted with a surplus of women men become promiscuous and unwilling to commit to a monogamous relationship Which I suppose might explain the Amazons� need to keep men in slave quarters In societies with too many women the theory holds fewer people marry and those who do marry do so later in life Because men take advantage of the variety of potential partners available to them women�s traditional roles are not valued and because these women can�t rely on their partners to stick around more turn to extrafamilial ambitions like education and career 
In 1988 the sociologists Scott J South and Katherine Trent set out to test the Guttentag-Secord theory by analyzing data from 117 countries Most aspects of the theory tested out In each country more men meant more married women less divorce and fewer women in the workforce South and Trent also found that the Guttentag-Secord dynamics were more pronounced in developed rather than developing countries In other words�capitalist men are pigs

I kid! And yet as a woman who spent her early 30s actively putting off marriage I have had ample time to investigate if you will the prevailing attitudes of the high-status American urban male Granted given my taste for brainy creatively ambitious men�or �scrawny nerds� as a high-school friend describes them�my sample is skewed My spotty anecdotal findings have revealed that yes in many cases the more successful a man is or thinks he is the less interested he is in commitment 
Take the high-powered magazine editor who declared on our first date that he was going to spend his 30s playing the field Or the prominent academic who announced on our fifth date that he couldn�t maintain a committed emotional relationship but was very interested in a physical one Or the novelist who after a month of hanging out said he had to get back out there and tomcat around but asked if we could keep having sex anyhow or at least just one last time Or the writer yes another one who announced after six months together that he had to end things because he �couldn�t continue fending off all the sexual offers� And those are just the honest ones 
To be sure these men were the outliers�the majority of my personal experience has been with commitment-minded men with whom things just didn�t work out for one reason or another Indeed another of my anecdotal-research discoveries is of what an ex calls �marriage o�clock��when a man hits 35 and suddenly desperately wants a wife I�ll never forget the post-first-date e-mail message reading: �I wanted to marry you last night just listening to you� Nor the 40-ish journalist who on our second date driving down a long country road gripped the steering wheel and asked �Are you The One? Are you The One?� Can you imagine a woman getting away with this kind of behavior? Like zealous lepidopterists they swoop down with their butterfly nets fingers aimed for the thorax certain that just because they are ready for marriage and children I must be too 
But the non-committers are out there in growing force If dating and mating is in fact a marketplace�and of course it is�today we�re contending with a new �dating gap� where marriage-minded women are increasingly confronted with either deadbeats or players For evidence we don�t need to look to the past or abroad�we have two examples right in front of us: the African American community and the college campus 
In August I traveled to Wilkinsburg Pennsylvania a small predominantly African American borough on the eastern edge of Pittsburgh A half-century ago it was known as �The Holy City� for its preponderance of churches Today the cobblestoned streets are lined with defeated clapboard houses that look as if the spirit�s been sucked right out of them 
I was there to spend the afternoon with Denean a 34-year-old nurse who was living in one such house with three of her four children the eldest is 19 and lived across town and these days a teenage niece Denean is pretty and slender with a wry deadpan humor For 10 years she worked for a health-care company but she was laid off in January She is twice divorced; no two of her children share a father In February when she learned on Facebook that her second child 15-year-old Ronicka was pregnant Denean slumped down on her enormous slate-gray sofa and didn�t get up for 10 hours 
�I had done everything I could to make sure she didn�t end up like me and now this� she told me 
It was a clear warm day and we were clustered on the front porch�Denean Ronicka and I along with Denean�s niece Keira 18 and Denean�s friend Chantal 28 a single mother whose daughter goes to day care with Denean�s youngest The affection between these four high-spirited women was light and infectious and they spoke knowingly about the stigmas they�re up against �That�s right� Denean laughed �we�re your standard bunch of single black moms!� 
Given the crisis in gender it has suffered through for the past half century the African American population might as well be a separate nation An astonishing 70 percent of black women are unmarried and they are more than twice as likely as white women to remain that way Those black women who do marry are more likely than any other group of women to �marry down� This is often chalked up to high incarceration rates�in 2009 of the nearly 15 million men in prison 39 percent were black�but it�s more than that Across all income levels black men have dropped far behind black women professionally and educationally; women with college degrees outnumber men 2-to-1 In August the unemployment rate among black men age 20 or older exceeded 17 percent 
In his book Is Marriage for White People? Ralph Richard Banks a law professor at Stanford argues that the black experience of the past half century is a harbinger for society at large �When you�re writing about black people white people may assume it�s unconnected to them� he told me when I got him on the phone It might seem easy to dismiss Banks�s theory that what holds for blacks may hold for nonblacks if only because no other group has endured such a long history of racism and racism begets singular ills But the reality is that what�s happened to the black family is already beginning to happen to the white family In 1950 64 percent of African American women were married�roughly the same percentage as white women By 1965 African American marriage rates had declined precipitously and Daniel Patrick Moynihan was famously declaring black families a �tangle of pathology� Black marriage rates have fallen drastically in the years since�but then so have white marriage rates In 1965 when Moynihan wrote with such concern about the African American family fewer than 25 percent of black children were born out of wedlock; in 2011 considerably more than 25 percent of white children are 
This erosion of traditional marriage and family structure has played out most dramatically among low-income groups both black and white According to the sociologist William Julius Wilson inner-city black men struggled badly in the 1970s as manufacturing plants shut down or moved to distant suburbs These men naturally resented their downward mobility and had trouble making the switch to service jobs requiring a very different style of self-presentation The joblessness and economic insecurity that resulted created a host of problems and made many men altogether unmarriable Today as manufacturing jobs disappear nationwide American manufacturing shed about a third of its jobs during the first decade of this century the same phenomenon may be under way but on a much larger scale 
Just as the decline of marriage in the black underclass augured the decline of marriage in the white underclass the decline of marriage in the black middle class has prefigured the decline of marriage in the white middle class In the 1990s the author Terry McMillan climbed the best-seller list and box-office charts with novels like Waiting to Exhale and How Stella Got Her Groove Back which provided incisive glimpses of life and frustrated romance among middle-class black women where the prospect of marrying a black man often seemed more or less hopeless As she writes in Waiting to Exhale: �[Successful black men have] taken these stupid statistics about us to heart and are having the time of their lives They do not hold themselves accountable to anybody for anything and they�re getting away with murder � They lie to us without a conscience they fuck as many of us at a time as they want to� Today with the precipitous economic and social decline of men of all races it�s easy to see why women of any race would feel frustrated by their romantic prospects Is it any wonder marriage rates have fallen? Increasingly this extends to the upper-middle class too: early last year a study by the Pew Research Center reported that professionally successful college-educated women were confronted with a shrinking pool of like-minded marriage prospects 
�If you�re a successful black man in New York City one of the most appealing and sought-after men around your options are plentiful� Banks told me �Why marry if you don�t have to?� Or as he quotes one black man in his book �If you have four quality women you�re dating and they�re in a rotation who�s going to rush into a marriage?� Banks�s book caused a small stir by suggesting that black women should expand their choices by marrying outside their race�a choice that the women of Terry McMillan�s novels would have found at best unfortunate and at worst an abhorrent betrayal As it happens the father of Chantal�s child is white and Denean has dated across the color line But in any event the decline in the economic prospects of white men means that marrying outside their race can expand African American women�s choices only so far Increasingly the new dating gap�where women are forced to choose between deadbeats and players�trumps all else in all socioeconomic brackets 
The early 1990s witnessed the dawn of �hookup culture� at universities as colleges stopped acting in loco parentis and undergraduates heady with freedom started throwing themselves into a frenzy of one-night stands Depending on whom you ask this has either liberated young women from being ashamed of their sexual urges or forced them into a promiscuity they didn�t ask for Young men apparently couldn�t be happier

According to Robert H Frank an economist at Cornell who has written on supply and demand in the marriage market this shouldn�t be surprising When the available women significantly outnumber men which is the case on many campuses today �courtship behavior changes in the direction of what men want� he told me recently If women greatly outnumber men he says social norms against casual sex will weaken He qualifies this by explaining that no matter how unbalanced the overall sex ratio may become in either direction �there will always be specific men and women who are in high demand as romantic partners�think Pen�lope Cruz and George Clooney� But even Cruz and Clooney Frank says will be affected by changing mores The likelihood increases �that even a highly sought-after woman will engage in casual sex even though she would have sufficient market power to defy prevailing norms� If a woman with the �market power� of a Pen�lope Cruz is affected by this what are the rest of us to do? 
Whether the sexual double standard is cultural or biological it�s finding traction in the increasingly lopsided sexual marketplace that is the American college campus where women outnumber men 57 percent to 43 percent In 2010 The New York Times ran a much-discussed article chronicling this phenomenon �If a guy is not getting what he wants he can quickly and abruptly go to the next one because there are so many of us� a University of Georgia co-ed told The Times reporting that at college parties and bars she will often see two guys being fawned over by six provocatively dressed women The alternative is just to give up on dating and romance because �there are no guys� as a University of North Carolina student put it 
Last year a former management consultant named Susan Walsh tried to dig a little deeper She applied what economists call the Pareto principle�the idea that for many events roughly 20 percent of the causes create 80 percent of the effects�to the college dating market and concluded that only 20 percent of the men those considered to have the highest status are having 80 percent of the sex with only 20 percent of the women those with the greatest sexual willingness; the remaining 80 percent male and female sit out the hookup dance altogether Surprisingly a 2007 study commissioned by the Justice Department suggested that male virgins outnumber female virgins on campus As Walsh puts it most of the leftover men are �have nots� in terms of access to sex and most of the women�both those who are hooking up and those who are not�are �have nots� in terms of access to male attention that leads to commitment Of course plenty of women are perfectly happy with casual no-strings sex but they are generally considered to be in the minority Yet the myth of everyone having sex all the time is so pervasive that it�s assumed to be true which distorts how young men and women relate �I think the 80/20 principle is the key to understanding the situation we find ourselves in�one in which casual sex is the cultural norm despite the fact that most people would actually prefer something quite different� Walsh told me 
I became aware of Walsh this past summer when I happened upon her blog HookingUpSmartcom and lost an evening to one of those late-night Internet binges each link leading to the next drawn into a boy-girl conversation to end all boy-girl conversations A frumpy beige Web-site palette and pragmatic voice belie a refreshingly frank at times even raunchy dialogue; postings in the comments section can swell into the high hundreds�interestingly the majority of them from men I felt as if I�d stumbled into the online equivalent of a progressive school nurse�s office 
A Wharton MBA and stay-at-home mother of two Walsh began her career as a relationship adviser turned blogger six years ago when her daughter then a student at an all-girls high school started dating She began seeking counsel from Walsh and liked what she heard as did her friends when she told them; in time the girls were regularly gathering around Walsh�s kitchen table to pick her brain Soon enough a childhood friend�s daughter a sophomore at Boston University started coming over with her friends Walsh started thinking of these �70s-style rap sessions as her own informal �focus groups� the members of one still in high school those of the other in college but all of them having similar experiences In 2008 after the younger group had left home Walsh started the blog so they could all continue the conversation 
In July I traveled to Walsh�s home a handsome 19th-century Victorian hidden behind tall hedges in a quiet corner of Brookline Massachusetts to sit in on one of these informal roundtables I came of age with hookup culture but not of it having continued through college my high-school habit of serial long-term relationships and I wanted to hear from the front lines What would these sexual buccaneers be like? Bold and provocative? Worn-out and embittered? 
When Walsh opened the door I could immediately see why young women find her so easy to talk to; her brunette bob frames bright green eyes and a warm easy smile Once everyone had arrived�five recent college graduates all of them white and upper middle class some employed and some still looking for work all unmarried�we sat down to a dinner of chicken and salad in Walsh�s high-ceilinged wood-paneled dining room to weigh in on one of the evening�s topics: man whores 
�How do you all feel about guys who get with a ton of girls?� Walsh asked �Do you think they have �trash dick�?� She�d run across this term on the Internet 
One of Walsh�s pet observations pertains to what she calls the �soft harem� where high-status men ie the football captain maintain an �official� girlfriend as well as a rotating roster of neo-concubines who service him in the barroom bathroom or wherever the beer is flowing �There used to be more assortative mating� she explained �where a five would date a five But now every woman who is a six and above wants the hottest guy on campus and she can have him�for one night�

As I�d expected these denizens of hookup culture were far more sexually experienced than I�d been at their age Some had had many partners and they all joked easily about sexual positions and penis size �I was like �That�s a pinkie not a penis!�� with the offhand knowledge only familiarity can breed Most of them said that though they�d had a lot of sex none of it was particularly sensual or exciting It appears that the erotic promises of the 1960s sexual revolution have run aground on the shoals of changing sex ratios where young women and men come together in fumbling drunken couplings fueled less by lust than by a vague sense of social conformity I can�t help wondering: Did this de-eroticization of sex encourage the rise of pornography? Or is it that pornography endows the inexperienced with a toolbox of socially sanctioned postures and tricks ensuring that one can engage in what amounts to a public exchange according to a pre-approved script? For centuries women�s sexuality was repressed by a patriarchal marriage system; now what could be an era of heady carnal delights is stifled by a new form of male entitlement this one fueled by demographics 
Most striking to me was the innocence of these young women Of these attractive and vivacious females only two had ever had a �real� boyfriend�as in a mutually exclusive and satisfying relationship rather than a series of hookups�and for all their technical know-how they didn�t seem to be any wiser than I�d been at their age This surprised me; I�d assumed that growing up in a jungle would give them a more matter-of-fact or at least less conventional worldview Instead when I asked if they wanted to get married when they grew up and if so at what age to a one they answered �yes� and �27 or 28� 
�That�s only five or six years from now� I pointed out �Doesn�t that seem�not far off?� 
They nodded 
�Take a look at me� I said �I�ve never been married and I have no idea if I ever will be There�s a good chance that this will be your reality too Does that freak you out?� 
Again they nodded 
�I don�t think I can bear doing this for that long!� whispered one with undisguised alarm 

I remember experiencing that same panicked exhaustion around the time I turned 36 at which point I�d been in the dating game for longer than that alarmed 22-year-old had and I wanted out Is there an expiration date on the fun running-around period of being single captured so well by movies and television? I�d spent the past year with a handsome commitment-minded man and these better qualities along with our having several interests in common allowed me to overlook our many thundering incompatibilities In short I was creeping up on marriage o�clock and I figured Enough already�I had to make something work When it became clear that sheer will wasn�t going to save us I went to bed one night and had a rare dream about my late mother 
�Mom� I said �Things aren�t working out I�m breaking up with him tomorrow� 
�Oh honey� she said �I am so sorry We were rooting for this one weren�t we? When something doesn�t work though what can you do?� 
This I found irritating �Mom I am getting old� 
�Pwhah!� she scoffed �You�re fine You�ve got six more years� 
Six more years I woke up In six more years I�d be 42 All this time I�d been regarding my single life as a temporary interlude one I had to make the most of�or swiftly terminate depending on my mood Without intending to by actively rejecting our pop-culture depictions of the single woman�you know the ones�I�d been terrorizing myself with their specters But now that 35 had come and gone and with yet another relationship up in flames all bets were off It might never happen Or maybe not until 42 Or 70 for that matter Was that so bad? If I stopped seeing my present life as provisional perhaps I�d be a little � happier Perhaps I could actually get down to the business of what it means to be a real single woman 
It�s something a lot of people might want to consider given that now by choice or by circumstance more and more of us women and men across the economic spectrum are spending more years of our adult lives unmarried than ever before The numbers are striking: The Census Bureau has reported that in 2010 the proportion of married households in America dropped to a record low of 48 percent Fifty percent of the adult population is single compared with 33 percent in 1950�and that portion is very likely to keep growing given the variety of factors that contribute to it The median age for getting married has been rising and for those who are affluent and educated that number climbs even higher Indeed Stephanie Coontz told me that an educated white woman of 40 is more than twice as likely to marry in the next decade as a less educated woman of the same age Last year nearly twice as many single women bought homes as did single men And yet what are our ideas about single people? Perverted misanthropes crazy cat ladies dating-obsessed shoe shoppers etc�all of them some form of terribly lonely In her 2008 memoir Epilogue a 70-something Anne Roiphe muses: �There are millions of women who live alone in America Some of them are widows Some of them are divorced and between connections some of them are odd loners who prefer to keep their habits undisturbed� That�s a pretty good representation of her generation�s notions of unmarried women 
Famous Bolick family story: When I was a little girl my mother and I went for a walk and ran into her friend Regina They talked for a few minutes caught up I gleaned from their conversation that Regina wasn�t married and as soon as we made our goodbyes I bombarded my mother with questions �No husband? How could that be? She�s a grown-up! Grown-ups have husbands!� My mother explained that not all grown-ups get married �Then who opens the pickle jar?� I was 5 
Thus began my lifelong fascination with the idea of the single woman There was my second-grade teacher Mrs Connors who was I believe a former nun or seemed like one There was the director of my middle-school gifted-and-talented program who struck me as wonderfully remote and original Was she a lesbian? There was a college poetry professor a brilliant single woman in her 40s who had never been married rather glamorously I thought Once I told her I wanted to be just like her �Good God� she said �I�ve made a mess of my life Don�t look to me� Why did they all seem so mysterious even marginalized? 
Back when I believed my mother had a happy marriage�and she did for quite a long time really�she surprised me by confiding that one of the most blissful moments of her life had been when she was 21 driving down the highway in her VW Beetle with nowhere to go except wherever she wanted to be �I had my own car my own job all the clothes I wanted� she remembered wistfully Why couldn�t she have had more of that? 
When I embarked on my own sojourn as a single woman in New York City�talk about a timeworn clich�!�it wasn�t dating I was after I was seeking something more vague and in my mind more noble having to do with finding my own way and independence And I found all that Early on I sometimes ached watching so many friends pair off�and without a doubt there has been loneliness At times I�ve envied my married friends for being able to rely on a spouse to help make difficult decisions or even just to carry the bills for a couple of months And yet I�m perhaps inordinately proud that I�ve never depended on anyone to pay my way today that strikes me as a quaint achievement but there you have it Once when my father consoled me with the best of intentions for being so unlucky in love I bristled I�d gotten to know so many interesting men and experienced so much Wasn�t that a form of luck? 
All of which is to say that the single woman is very rarely seen for who she is�whatever that might be�by others or even by the single woman herself so thoroughly do most of us internalize the stigmas that surround our status 
Bella DePaulo a Harvard-trained social psychologist who is now a visiting professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara is America�s foremost thinker and writer on the single experience In 2005 she coined the word singlism in an article she published in Psychological Inquiry Intending a parallel with terms like racism and sexism DePaulo says singlism is �the stigmatizing of adults who are single [and] includes negative stereotyping of singles and discrimination against singles� In her 2006 book Singled Out she argues that the complexities of modern life and the fragility of the institution of marriage have inspired an unprecedented glorification of coupling Laura Kipnis the author of Against Love has called this �the tyranny of two� This marriage myth��matrimania� DePaulo calls it�proclaims that the only route to happiness is finding and keeping one all-purpose all-important partner who can meet our every emotional and social need Those who don�t have this are pitied Those who don�t want it are seen as threatening Singlism therefore �serves to maintain cultural beliefs about marriage by derogating those whose lives challenge those beliefs� 
In July I visited DePaulo in the improbably named Summerland California which as one might hope is a charming outpost overlooking a glorious stretch of the Pacific Ocean DePaulo a warm curious woman in her late 50s describes herself as �single at heart��meaning that she�s always been single and always will be and that�s just the way she wants it Over lunch at a seafood restaurant she discussed how the cultural fixation on the couple blinds us to the full web of relationships that sustain us on a daily basis We are far more than whom we are or aren�t married to: we are also friends grandparents colleagues cousins and so on To ignore the depth and complexities of these networks is to limit the full range of our emotional experiences 
Personally I�ve been wondering if we might be witnessing the rise of the aunt based on the simple fact that my brother�s two small daughters have brought me emotional rewards I never could have anticipated I have always been very close with my family but welcoming my nieces into the world has reminded me anew of what a gift it is to care deeply even helplessly about another There are many ways to know love in this world 
This is not to question romantic love itself Rather we could stand to examine the ways in which we think about love; and the changing face of marriage is giving us a chance to do this �Love comes from the motor of the mind the wanting part that craves that piece of chocolate or a work promotion� Helen Fisher a biological anthropologist and perhaps this country�s leading scholar of love told me That we want is enduring; what we want changes as culture does 
Our cultural fixation on the couple is actually a relatively recent development Though �pair-bonding� has been around for 35 million years according to Helen Fisher the hunters and gatherers evolved in egalitarian groups with men and women sharing the labor equally Both left the camp in the morning; both returned at day�s end with their bounty Children were raised collaboratively As a result women and men were sexually and socially more or less equals; divorce or its institution-of-marriage-preceding equivalent was common Indeed Fisher sees the contemporary trend for marriage between equals as us �moving forward into deep history��back to the social and sexual relationships of millions of years ago 
It wasn�t until we moved to farms and became an agrarian economy centered on property that the married couple became the central unit of production As Stephanie Coontz explains by the Middle Ages the combination of the couple�s economic interdependence and the Catholic Church�s success in limiting divorce had created the tradition of getting married to one person and staying that way until death do us part It was in our personal and collective best interest that the marriage remain intact if we wanted to keep the farm afloat 
That said being too emotionally attached to one�s spouse was discouraged; neighbors family and friends were valued just as highly in terms of practical and emotional support Even servants and apprentices shared the family table and sometimes slept in the same room with the couple who headed the household Coontz notes Until the mid-19th century the word love was used to describe neighborly and familial feelings more often than to describe those felt toward a mate and same-sex friendships were conducted with what we moderns would consider a romantic intensity When honeymoons first started in the 19th century the newlyweds brought friends and family along for the fun 
But as the 19th century progressed and especially with the sexualization of marriage in the early 20th century these older social ties were drastically devalued in order to strengthen the bond between the husband and wife�with contradictory results As Coontz told me �When a couple�s relationship is strong a marriage can be more fulfilling than ever But by overloading marriage with more demands than any one individual can possibly meet we unduly strain it and have fewer emotional systems to fall back on if the marriage falters� 
Some even believe that the pair bond far from strengthening communities which is both the prevailing view of social science and a central tenet of social conservatism weakens them the idea being that a married couple becomes too consumed with its own tiny nation of two to pay much heed to anyone else In 2006 the sociologists Naomi Gerstel and Natalia Sarkisian published a paper concluding that unlike singles married couples spend less time keeping in touch with and visiting their friends and extended family and are less likely to provide them with emotional and practical support They call these �greedy marriages� I can see how couples today might be driven to form such isolated nations�it�s not easy in this age of dual-career families and hyper-parenting to keep the wheels turning never mind having to maintain outside relationships as well And yet we continue to rank this arrangement above all else! 
Now that women are financially independent and marriage is an option rather than a necessity we are free to pursue what the British sociologist Anthony Giddens termed the �pure relationship� in which intimacy is sought in and of itself and not solely for reproduction If I may quote the eminently quotable Gloria Steinem again: �I can�t mate in captivity� Certainly in a world where women can create their own social standing concepts like �marrying up� and �marrying down� evaporate�to the point where the importance of conventional criteria such as age and height Coontz says has fallen to an all-time low no pun intended in the United States 
Everywhere I turn I see couples upending existing norms and power structures whether it�s women choosing to be with much younger men or men choosing to be with women more financially successful than they are or both at once My friend M a successful filmmaker fell in love with her dog walker a man 12 years her junior; they stayed together for three years and are best friends today As with many such relationships I didn�t even know about their age difference until I became a member of their not-so-secret society At a rooftop party last September a man 11 years my junior asked me out for dinner; I didn�t take him seriously for one second�and then the next thing I knew we were driving to his parents� house for Christmas When I mentioned what I considered to be this scandalous age difference to the actress Julianne Moore after a newspaper interview that had turned chatty and intimate she e-mailed me to say �In terms of scandalously young�I have been with my 9-years-younger husband for 15 years now�so there you go!� The same goes for couples where the woman is taller Dalton Conley the dean for the social sciences at New York University recently analyzed data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and found a 40 percent increase between 1986 and 2003 in men who are shorter than their wives Most research confirms casual observation: when it comes to judging a prospective mate on the basis of looks women are the more lenient gender 
Perhaps true to conservative fears the rise of gay marriage has helped heterosexuals think more creatively about their own conventions News stories about polyamory �ethical nonmonogamy� and the like pop up with increasing frequency Gay men have traditionally had a more permissive attitude toward infidelity; how will this influence the straight world? Coontz points out that two of the hallmarks of contemporary marriage are demands for monogamy on an equal basis and candor �Throughout history there was a fairly high tolerance of [men�s] extramarital flings with women expected to look the other way� she said �Now we have to ask: Can we be more monogamous? Or understand that flings happen?� She�s also noticed that an unexpected consequence of people�s marrying later is that they skip right over the cheating years If we�re ready to rethink as individuals the ways in which we structure our arrangements are we ready to do this as a society? 
In her new book Unhitched Judith Stacey a sociologist at NYU surveys a variety of unconventional arrangements from gay parenthood to polygamy to�in a mesmerizing case study�the Mosuo people of southwest China who eschew marriage and visit their lovers only under cover of night �The sooner and better our society comes to terms with the inescapable variety of intimacy and kinship in the modern world the fewer unhappy families it will generate� she writes 
The matrilineal Mosuo are worth pausing on as a reminder of how complex family systems can be and how rigid ours are�and also as an example of women�s innate libidinousness which is routinely squelched by patriarchal systems as Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jeth� point out in their own analysis of the Mosuo in their 2010 book Sex at Dawn For centuries the Mosuo have lived in households that revolve around the women: the mothers preside over their children and grandchildren and brothers take paternal responsibility for their sisters� offspring 
Sexual relations are kept separate from family At night a Mosuo woman invites her lover to visit her babahuago flower room; the assignation is called sese walking If she�d prefer he not sleep over he�ll retire to an outer building never home to his sisters She can take another lover that night or a different one the next or sleep every single night with the same man for the rest of her life�there are no expectations or rules As Cai Hua a Chinese anthropologist explains these relationships which are known as a�ia are founded on each individual�s autonomy and last only as long as each person is in the other�s company Every goodbye is taken to be the end of the a�ia relationship even if it resumes the following night �There is no concept of a�ia that applies to the future� Hua says 
America has a rich history of its own sexually alternative utopias from the 19th-century Oneida Community which encouraged postmenopausal women to introduce teenage males to sex to the celibate Shakers but real change can seldom take hold when economic forces remain static The extraordinary economic flux we�re in is what makes this current moment so distinctive 

In the months leading to my breakup with Allan my problem as I saw it lay in wanting two incompatible states of being�autonomy and intimacy�and this struck me as selfish and juvenile; part of growing up I knew was making trade-offs I was too ashamed to confide in anyone and as far as I could tell mine was an alien predicament anyhow; apparently women everywhere wanted exactly what I possessed: a good man; a marriage-in-the-making; a �we� 
So I started searching out stories about those who had gone off-script with unconventional arrangements I had to page back through an entire century down past the riot grrrls then the women�s libbers then the flappers before I found people who talked about love in a way I could relate to: the free-thinking adventurers of early-1900s Greenwich Village Susan Glaspell Neith Boyce Edna St Vincent Millay�they investigated the limits and possibilities of intimacy with a naive audacity and a touching decorum that I found familiar and comforting I am not a bold person To read their essays and poems was to perform a shy ideological striptease to the sweetly insistent warble of a gramophone 
�We are not designed as a species to raise children in nuclear families� Christopher Ryan one of the Sex at Dawn co-authors told me over the telephone late last summer Women who try to be �supermoms� whether single or married holding down a career and running a household simultaneously are �swimming upstream� Could we have a modernization of the Mosuo Ryan mused with several women and their children living together�perhaps in one of the nation�s many foreclosed and abandoned McMansions�bonding sharing expenses having a higher quality of life? �In every society where women have power�whether humans or primates�the key is female bonding� he added 
Certainly letting men off the hook isn�t progress But as we talked I couldn�t help thinking about the women in Wilkinsburg�an inadvertent all-female coalition�and how in spite of it all they derived so much happiness from each other�s company That underprivileged communities are often forced into matrilineal arrangements in the absence of reliable males has been well documented by the University of Virginia sociologist W Bradford Wilcox among others and I am not in any way romanticizing these circumstances Nor am I arguing that we should discourage marriage�it�s a tried-and-true model for raising successful children in a modern economy Evidence suggests that American children who grow up amidst the disorder that is common to single-parent homes tend to struggle But we would do well to study and to endorse alternative family arrangements that might provide strength and stability to children as they grow up I am curious to know what could happen if these de facto female support systems of the sort I saw in Wilkinsburg were recognized as an adaptive response even an evolutionary stage that women could be proud to build and maintain 
I definitely noticed an increase in my own contentment when I began to develop and pay more attention to friendships with women who like me have never been married Their worldviews feel relaxingly familiar and give me the space to sort through my own ambivalence That�s an abstract benefit More concretely there�s what my brother terms our �immigrant bucket brigade��my peer group�s habit of jumping to the ready to help each other with matters practical and emotional This isn�t to say that my married friends aren�t as supportive�some of my best friends are married!�it�s just that with families of their own they can�t be as available 
Indeed my single friends housed me as I flew around the world to research this article; by the end I had my own little unwritten monograph on the very rich lives of the modern-day single woman Deb gave me the use of her handsome mid-century apartment in Chelsea when she vacated town for a meditation retreat; Courtney bequeathed her charming Brooklyn aerie while she traveled alone through Italy; Catherine put me up at her rambling Cape Cod summer house; when my weekend at Maria�s place on Shelter Island unexpectedly ballooned into two weeks she set me up in my own little writing room; when a different Courtney needed to be nursed through an operation I stayed for four days to write paragraphs between changing bandages 
The sense of community we create for one another puts me in mind of the 19th-century availability of single-sex hotels and boarding houses which were a necessity when women were discouraged from living alone and then became an albatross when they finally weren�t So last year inspired by visions of New York�s �women only� Barbizon Hotel in its heyday I persuaded my childhood friend Willamain to take over the newly available apartment in my building in Brooklyn Heights We�ve known each other since we were 5 and I thought it would be a great comfort to us both to spend our single lives just a little less atomized It�s worked These days I think of us as a mini-neo-single-sex residential hotel of two We collect one another�s mail when necessary share kitchenware tend to one another when sick fall into long conversations when we least expect it�all the benefits of dorm living without the gross bathrooms 
Could we create something bigger and more intentional? In August I flew to Amsterdam to visit an iconic medieval bastion of single-sex living The Begijnhof was founded in the mid-12th century as a religious all-female collective devoted to taking care of the sick The women were not nuns but nor were they married and they were free to cancel their vows and leave at any time Over the ensuing centuries very little has changed Today the religious trappings are gone though there is an active chapel on site and to be accepted an applicant must be female and between the ages of 30 and 65 and commit to living alone The institution is beloved by the Dutch and gaining entry isn�t easy The waiting list is as long as the turnover is low 
I�d heard about the Begijnhof through a friend who once knew an American woman who lived there named Ellen I contacted an old boyfriend who now lives in Amsterdam to see if he knew anything about it thank you Facebook and he put me in touch with an American friend who has lived there for 12 years: the very same Ellen 
The Begijnhof is big�106 apartments in all�but even so I nearly pedaled right past it on my rented bicycle hidden as it is in plain sight: a walled enclosure in the middle of the city set a meter lower than its surroundings Throngs of tourists sped past toward the adjacent shopping district In the wall is a heavy rounded wood door I pulled it open and walked through 
Inside was an enchanted garden: a modest courtyard surrounded by classic Dutch houses of all different widths and heights Roses and hydrangea lined walkways and peeked through gates The sounds of the city were indiscernible As I climbed the narrow twisting stairs to Ellen�s sun-filled garret she leaned over the railing in welcome�white hair cut in a bob smiling red-painted lips A writer and producer of avant-garde radio programs Ellen 60 has a chic minimal style that carries over into her little two-floor apartment which can�t be more than 300 square feet Neat and efficient in the way of a ship the place has large windows overlooking the courtyard and rooftops below To be there is like being held in a nest 
We drank tea and talked and Ellen rolled her own cigarettes and smoked thoughtfully She talked about how the Dutch don�t regard being single as peculiar in any way�people are as they are She feels blessed to live at the Begijnhof and doesn�t ever want to leave Save for one or two friends on the premises socially she holds herself aloof; she has no interest in being ensnared by the gossip on which a few of the residents thrive�but she loves knowing that they�re there Ellen has a partner but since he�s not allowed to spend the night they split time between her place and his nearby home �If you want to live here you have to adjust and you have to be creative� Ellen said When I asked her if starting a relationship was a difficult decision after so many years of pleasurable solitude she looked at me meaningfully and said �It wasn�t a choice�it was a certainty� 
When an American woman gives you a tour of her house she leads you through all the rooms Instead this expat showed me her favorite window views: from her desk from her single bed from her reading chair As I perched for a moment in each spot trying her life on for size I thought about the years I�d spent struggling against the four walls of my apartment and I wondered what my mother�s life would have been like had she lived and divorced my father A room of one�s own for each of us A place where single women can live and thrive as themselves 



�You would be amazed to find how often we mislead ourselves regardless of how smart we think we are when we attempt to explain why we are behaving the way we do� Dichter observed in 1960 in his book �The Strategy of Desire� He held that marketplace decisions are driven by emotions and subconscious whims and fears and often have little to do with the product itself Trained as a psychoanalyst Dichter saw human motivation as an �iceberg� with two-thirds hidden from view even to the decision-maker �What people actually spend their money on in most instances are psychological differences illusory brand images� he explained
At a time when national companies were aggressively jockeying for position among Americans�a suddenly cash-happy and acquisitive bunch�Dichter promised a way to influence consumers� brains If shopping was an emotional minefield then strategic marketing could be a gold mine for companies
Between the late 1930s and 1960s Dichter became famous for transforming the fates of businesses such as Procter & Gamble Exxon Chrysler General Mills and DuPont His insight changed the way hundreds of products were sold from cars to cake mix He pioneered research techniques such as the focus group understood the power of word-of-mouth persuasion and earned startling fees for his theories By the late 1950s his global business reached an annual turnover of $1m $8m today and he enjoyed a reputation as the Freud of the supermarket age
Dichter�s radical approach to goading shoppers called �motivational research� was considered so successful that he was even accused of threatening America�s national well-being Americans have become �the most manipulated people outside the Iron Curtain� complained Vance Packard a sociologist and virulent critic in his 1957 book �The Hidden Persuaders� Even so Dichter�s fame waned long before he died in 1991 He spent his later years as a discarded guru in Peekskill New York scribbling the occasional book about management or motivation Media research moved on; his name has largely been forgotten Yet many of his ideas about the role of the unconscious in sales are now back in fashion
Well before Dichter and Freudian analysis American businesses had spent decades trying to decipher market patterns Such efforts date from the late 19th century when new polling techniques were used to suss out the needs of consumers This trend picked up after the first world war as national brands began dominating the marketplace and companies invested more time and money in edging out competitors In the late 1920s and 1930s advertising executives were encouraged to mingle with the masses to discern preferences and interview shoppers
But these surveys were ultimately slapdash and speculative Businesses were recognising the limits of quantitative studies dismissively described as �nose counting� which offered little genuine insight into how customers behaved Asking shoppers why they bought particular products was like �asking people why they thought they were neurotic� quipped Dichter
In fact he believed most people have no idea why they buy things They might answer questions in an effort to be helpful particularly in the early 20th century when consumers were chuffed to be asked to share their thoughts But these were attempts to make sense of decisions retrospectively To understand what truly motivated people Dichter said it was necessary to get them to talk at length about their everyday habits Instead of subjecting many people to quick questionnaires he preferred a deep psychoanalytical approach with fewer participants: �If you let somebody talk long enough you can read between the lines to find out what he really means�
Dichter had arrived in America in 1938 the perfect time for these ideas to take off The intellectual environment was just opening up to new and unorthodox concepts; Freudian psychology was becoming sexy The idea that there was more to human behaviour than meets the eye was becoming widespread Freud�s notions of subconscious urges and socialised inhibitions seemed to make intuitive sense Even Albert Einstein America�s patron saint of the hard sciences sought out Freud�s counsel in the run-up to the second world war praising him for his �critical judgment earnestness and responsibility�
Psychoanalysis became particularly popular in post-war America a time of abundance conformity and anxiety about being �abnormal� observes Lawrence Samuel author of �Freud on Madison Avenue� Nothing makes people more neurotic than the expectation that they should be enjoying themselves
For advertisers argues Mr Samuel Freud was a �godsend� When goods were scarce and people bought what they could get it was hardly necessary to understand consumer psychology But in an age of prosperity when supply outstripped demand and countless indistinguishable goods were competing for buyers companies had to rely more heavily on branding and advertising There was a clear need to improve upon existing campaigns which often simply announced the benefits of a product with grand promises and sparkling smiles for example a print ad from 1925 for Johnson�s Liquid Wax: �This New Easy Way to have Beautiful Waxed Floors�
 From Vienna to New York 
American businesses suddenly needed to understand and channel the desires of consumers And Dichter�well he �made their heads explode� says Mr Samuel
A 31-year-old Jewish psychologist fleeing Hitler�s rise in Europe Dichter came to New York with his wife Hedy and $100 in his pocket The city was suddenly full of fellow Austrian Jewish PhDs; with the help of Paul Lazarsfeld his former statistics teacher Dichter quickly got a job at a market-research firm in Manhattan Dichter is credited with popularising motivational research yet it was Lazarsfeld who first discovered the value of qualitative research based on lengthy interviews He understood the psychological roots of consumer decisions but he remained wedded to finding statistical proof for his theories and went on to found Columbia University�s Bureau of Applied Social Research
Dichter saw this as �naive empiricism� and decided to venture off on his own A gifted self-promoter he saw the city as a welcoming place for a young man with big ideas about subliminal desires sex and sales
In 1939 he wrote to six big American companies introducing himself as �a young psychologist from Vienna� with �some interesting new ideas which can help you be more successful effective sell more and communicate better� Mindful of Freud�s nascent appeal on Madison Avenue he emphasised that in Vienna they had lived on the same street Dichter had studied psychoanalysis in Austria but with Alfred Adler and Wilhelm Stekel not Freud himself With help from Lazarsfeld he heard back from four companies Having secured these contracts Dichter came up with the concepts that would make him famous
The consumer on the couch
What makes soap interesting? Why choose one brand over another? Dichter�s first contract was with the Compton Advertising Agency to help them sell Ivory soap Market research typically involved asking shoppers questions like �Why do you use this brand of soap?� Or more provocatively �Why don�t you use this brand of soap?� Regarding such lines of inquiry as useless Dichter instead conducted a hundred so-called �depth interviews� or open-ended conversations about his subjects� most recent scrubbing experiences
The approach was not unlike therapy with Dichter mining the responses for encoded unconscious motives and desires In the case of soap he found that bathing was a ritual that afforded rare moments of personal indulgence particularly before a romantic date �You never can tell� explained one woman He discerned an erotic element to bathing observing that �one of the few occasions when the puritanical American [is] allowed to caress himself or herself [is] while applying soap� As for why customers picked a particular brand Dichter concluded that it wasn�t exactly the smell or price or look or feel of the soap but all that and something else besides�that is the gestalt or �personality� of the soap
This was a big idea Dichter understood that every product has an image even a �soul� and is bought not merely for the purpose it serves but for the values it seems to embody Our possessions are extensions of our own personalities which serve as a �kind of mirror which reflects our own image� Dichter�s message to advertisers was: figure out the personality of a product and you will understand how to market it Soaps could be old or young flirty or conservative Ivory Dichter inferred had a �sombre utilitarian thoroughly cleansing character� It was the mother-daughter of soaps whereas a brand like Camay was a seductress Such insights led to the slogans �Be smart and get a fresh start with Ivory Soap� and �Wash your troubles away�
But the innovation that put Dichter on the marketing map involved a problem Chrysler was having with its relatively new line of Plymouth cars�which consumers were shunning Dichter headed out to Detroit conducted extensive interviews with a couple of hundred people and deduced that the company�s first problem was its existing advertising which boasted that its cars were �different from any other one you have ever tried� This evidently triggered an unconscious fear of the unknown among buyers for whom familiarity in a car meant safety
He also learned from interviews that whereas convertibles made up only 2% of sales in 1939 most men particularly middle-aged ones dreamed of owning one When convertibles were placed in the windows of dealerships as �bait� more men came in But when they returned actually to make a purchase they typically came with their wives and chose a sensible sedan the Plymouth line offered both
Dichter gathered that the convertible symbolised youth freedom and the secret wish for a mistress: an idle bit of temptation He suggested that Chrysler beef up its convertible advertising�and in recognition of spouses� role in the final decisions begin marketing cars in women�s magazines Meanwhile a new and more reassuring campaign emphasised that it would take �only a few minutes� to feel at home with the new Plymouth
Reporting on the campaign�s success Time described Dichter as �the first to apply to advertising the really scientific psychology� that tapped �hidden desires and urges� He chalked up his own success to the importance of examining �not how people should behave but how they do behave�
Don�t go overboard
Business was good for Dichter In 1946 he set up his Institute for Motivational Research in Croton-on-Hudson outside New York City; it was soon followed by a dozen satellite offices in America and abroad His unique approach to marketing�a mix of observation and imagination�was particularly popular in the 1950s when industry leaders would queue up �like desperate patients for a miracle medical doctor� writes Ronald Fullerton a marketing specialist and academic A charismatic salesman Dichter flipped Freud�s pessimistic ideas about childhood traumas and buried urges into opportunities for seeking pleasure and fulfilment in everyday purchases At a time when on-screen married couples still slept in separate beds his colourful take on the sexual relevance of ordinary objects got attention
Dichter�s case history is a fascinating mix of outlandish ideas and now-conventional solutions To elevate typewriter sales he suggested the machines be modelled on the female body �making the keyboard more receptive more concave� People smoke he explained because it is both a sign of virility and a legitimate excuse to interrupt the day for a moment of pleasure �comparable to sucking at the nipples of a gigantic world breast� A phallic shape to lipstick increased sales by the way it offered a subconscious invitation to fellatio �but one has to be careful not to go overboard and make the parallels too obvious� Dichter cautioned Prunes had an image problem as they were seen as a �symbol of old age� like �dried-out spinsters� To inspire demand Dichter suggested they be branded the �California Wonderfruit� and feature fresh supple plums on the packaging Prunes have been marketed using images of their younger selves ever since
Baking is an expression of femininity he explained so when a woman pulls a cake or loaf out of the oven �in a sense it is like giving birth� Thus mixes that require the cook to add only water are threatening to women since their role is marginalised; these days thanks to Dichter nearly all such mixes involve adding eggs a symbol of fertility In her book �Food is Love� Katherine Parkin notes the way he encouraged advertisers to impress on women the importance of cooking as a way of showing love
Dichter recognised that in the new world of America brands had become �a substitute for nobility and a family tree� People seek out products that correspond with the group they want to associate with Every object has a special meaning�one that often relates to sex insecurity or a desire for prestige He also understood that consumers felt guilt after buying self-indulgent products so marketers had to sell such things as tobacco and candy as �rewards� for the deserving Much of this is taken for granted now but when Dichter was whispering these sweet nothings in the ears of CEOs they were revelatory
 
For Dichter the ability to express oneself through shopping was a matter of great importance After a childhood that had been defined by serious poverty near-starvation and prejudice he saw America as a beacon of democratic capitalism with limitless opportunities to grow and express individuality Soon after immigrating he took lessons to drop his Viennese accent so he would sound �all-American� But he also viewed Americans as a puritanical bunch incapable of embracing change without anxiety or spending money without remorse He worried that this inability to enjoy progress would cripple the country�s economy which served as a crucial bulwark against the Soviet Union If consumer culture was America�s best defence against communism then motivating materialistic desires was an investment in the country�s future
Dichter�s colourful take on the sexual relevance of ordinary objects got attention
To ensure national security Americans needed to learn how to please themselves in realistic but ephemeral ways �To some extent the needs and wants of people have to be continuously stirred up� he argued so that everyone will work hard to buy what they desire In the early 1950s he discerned that when Americans borrowed money they preferred to do so from loan sharks at high interest rather than from a bank because they saw bankers as judgmental father figures whereas loan sharks lacked the authority to moralise He advised one bank to advertise checking accounts with overdraft facilities recognising that people wanted more money than they had but didn�t want to take out loans As for credit cards Dichter presciently called them �magic� for the way they provided �the American consumer with a symbol of inexhaustible potency� One can only imagine what he would make of America�s latter-day spendthrift habits
Yet the abundant 1950s also gave rise to criticism about the emptiness of affluence and the perversity of advertising In �The Hidden Persuaders� Packard targeted Dichter for exploiting the emotions of consumers to inspire a national glut of self-indulgence He claimed that motivational researchers such as Dichter with their scientific cunning and Freudian voodoo had unleashed the �chilling world of George Orwell and his Big Brother� Ironically Packard�s dramatic assessment of Dichter�s dark powers ended up bringing him plenty of new business
A year later John Kenneth Galbraith released �The Affluent Society� in which he described a country increasingly riven by economic divisions but too selfish to care Then in �The Feminine Mystique� in 1963 Betty Friedan took Dichter to task for being �paid approximately a million dollars a year for his professional services in manipulating the emotions of American women to serve the needs of business� Though women were taking important steps beyond the home Friedan accused advertisers of exploiting their homemaking insecurities in order to keep them in the kitchen with such gal pals as Betty Crocker and Aunt Jemima
 
Back to Vienna
By the early 1960s Freudian analysis was falling from favour The talking cure suddenly seemed too soft too unscientific and sometimes too weird This poisoned the market for Dichter�s insights which were often profound but occasionally bizarre and impossible either to validate or disprove In his book �Marketing Myths That Are Killing Business� Kevin Clancy describes hiring Dichter to weigh in on a Pepsi campaign �Kevin stop!� Dichter blurted �You are showing Pepsi in all these commercials with ice�You must not do this�You are associating your client with death!� His verdict labelled �too nutty� Dichter was sent packing
The rise of the computer in the 1960s introduced new quantitative methods of researching consumer attitudes which promised greater scientific purity Instead of presuming that secret motivations for buying detergent lurked in the traumatised subconscious it seemed safer and wiser to study behaviour and create mathematical models based on income and geography
Meanwhile the development of the cognitive sciences from the late 1950s through to the 1970s offered new empirical methods for considering such things as memory and problem-solving Psychologists anthropologists and behavioural scientists studied human behaviour to help understand mental development By the 1980s scientists exploring the brain were examining how people handle information and make decisions
But more recent developments in neuroscience have inspired fresh questions about instincts and desires unconscious prophesies and gut decisions New information about human cognition has led the hard sciences back to the same sort of concerns that preoccupied psychoanalysts in Vienna a century ago
Thus what was once the domain of Freud and Dichter has been appropriated by researchers in lab coats Yet many of the theories sound remarkably similar�albeit with rather less emphasis on Oedipal urges and castration anxieties �Recent published findings in neuroscience indicate it is emotion and not reason that drives our purchasing decisions� reported Mobile Marketer magazine earlier this year The quantitative trends that tossed Dichter aside have ultimately led back to his ideas
Companies selling insight into the consumer unconscious are now quick to couch their approach in empirical terms �Over 85% of consumer buying behaviour is driven by the non-conscious� explains Buyology Inc which launched in 2009 in New York as �the world�s leading strategic neuro-insight company� Using �statistically rigorous large-sample web-based tools� the company promises to unearth the real drivers of buying decisions Then there is the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique ZMET a patented interview process used by companies around the world that guarantees to go �beyond what people say to reveal what they actually mean� Rooted in neuroscience ZMET�s one-on-one exchanges use images and metaphors to get at the deeper thoughts and feelings of a consumer �A lot goes on in our minds that we�re not aware of� explained Gerald Zaltman a business professor at Harvard after he came up with the idea
 
�We�ve come back full circle� confirms Baba Shiv director of the Strategic Marketing Management Program at Stanford �Emotion is back in the unconscious is back in� It is now fashionable to study brain waves to see what lights up upon hearing the words �Coca Cola� or to measure pupil dilation in response to brand logos But these studies don�t explain why something is happening or what its effect might be in the real world Rather they create a framework for new assumptions new leaps of faith new ways to tell stories about the irrational choices people make Human behaviour remains mysterious and there is still no certain way to persuade people to buy a particular brand of soap Ernest Dichter knew that too but his stories about what motivates us are still some of the best around
