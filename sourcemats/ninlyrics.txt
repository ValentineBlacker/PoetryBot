God money Ill do anything for you
God money just tell me what you want me to
God money nail me up against the wall
God money dont want everything he wants it all


No you cant take it
No you cant take it
No you cant take that away from me
No you cant take it
No you cant take it
No you cant take that away from me

Head like a hole
Black as your soul
Id rather die than give you control
Head like a hole
Black as your soul
Id rather die than give you control


Bow down before the one you serve
Youre going to get what you deserve
Bow down before the one you serve
Youre going to get what you deserve

God moneys not looking for the cure
God moneys not concerned with the sick amongst the pure
God money lets go dancing on the backs of the bruised
God moneys not one to choose



You know who you are




Hey God why are you doing this to me
Am I not living up to what Im supposed to be
Why am I seething with this animosity
Hey God I think you owe me a great big apology


Terrible Lie 

Hey God I really dont know what you mean
Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
Hey God can this world really be as sad as it seems



Dont take it away from me I need you to hold on to
Dont tear it away from me I need someone to hold on to
Dont take it dont take it dont

Hey God Theres nothing left for me to hide
I lost my ignorance security and pride
Im all alone in a world you must despise
Hey God I believed your promises your promises and lie



You make me throw it all away
My morals left to decay
How many you betray
Youve taken everything
My head is filled with disease
My skin is begging you please
Im on my hands and knees
I want so much to believe



Kinda like a cloud I was up way up in the sky and I was feeling some feelings
You wouldnt believe sometimes I dont believe them myself and I decided I was
Never coming down just then a tiny little dot caught my eye it was just about
Too small to see but I watched it way too long and that dot was pulling me
Down


I was up about it
I was up above it
Now Im down in it
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now Im down in it

Well shut up so what what does it matter now I was swimming in the haze now I
Crawl on the ground and everything I never liked about you is kind of seeping
Into me try to laugh about it now but isnt it funny how everything works
Out "I guess the jokes on me" she said



I used to be so big and strong
I used to know my right from wrong
I used to never be afraid
I used to be somebody

I used to have something inside
Now just this hole thats open wide
I used to want it all
I used to be somebody

Ill cross my heart and hope to die but the needles already in my eye and
All the worlds weight is on my back and I dont even know why and what I
Used to think was me is just a fading memory
I looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye"



Its still getting worse after everything Ive tried
What if I found a way to wash it all inside
What if she touches with those fingertips
As the words spill out like fire from her lips

If she says come inside Ill come inside for her
If she says give it all Ill give everything to her


I am justified
I am purified
I am sancitifed inside you

Heavens just a rumor she dispells
As she walks me through the nicest parts of Hell
I still dream of lips I never should have kissed
Well she knows exactly what I cant resist

And if she says come inside Ill come inside for her
And if she says give it all Ill give everything to her



Im just caught up in another of her spells
While shes turning me into someone else
Every day I hope and pray that this will end
But when I can Id do it all again

And if she says come inside Ill come inside for her
And if she says give it all Ill give everything to her







I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head till I dont wanna sleep anymore


You make this all go away
You make this all go away
Im down to just one thing
And Im starting to scare myself

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldnt do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart


Come on and tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
Im down to just one thing
And Im starting to scare myself

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now
I know its still the same
Everywhere I look youre all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be


Come on and tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
Im down to just one thing
And Im starting to scare myself

You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have



I cant shake this feeling from my head
Theres a devil sleeping in my bed
Hes watching you from across the way
I cannot make this feeling go away


I know its not the right thing
And I know its not the good thing
Kinda I want to

Im not sure of what I should do
When everything Im think of is you
All of my excuses turn to lies
Maybe God will cover up his eyes



Kind I want to
Maybe just for tonight
We can pretend its alright
Whats the price I pay
I dont care what they say
I want to



You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my Purity
My Purity you stole
Did you think I wouldnt recognize this compromise
Am I just too stupid to realize
Stale incense old sweat and lies lies lies


It comes down to this
Your kiss
Your fist
And your strain
It gets under my skin
Within
Take in the extent of my sin

You give me the anger
You give me the nerve
Carry out my sentence
Well I get what I deserve
Im just an effigy to be disgraced
To be defaced
Well your need for me has been replaced
And if I cant have everything well then just give me a taste



You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my Purity
My Purity you stole
Did you think I wouldnt recognize this compromise
Am I just too stupid to realize
Stale incense old sweat and lies lies lies






Just when everything was making sense
You took away all my self-confidence
Now all that Ive been hearing must be true
I guess Im not the only boy for you


But thats what I get
Thats what I get
Thats what I get
Thats what I get

How could you turn me into this
After you just taught me how to kiss you
I told you Id never say goodbye
Now Im slipping on the tears you made me cry



Why does it come as a surprise;
To think that I was so naive
Maybe didnt mean that much
But it meant everything to me



Im drunk
Right now Im so in love with you
And I dont want to think too much about what we should or shouldnt do
Lay my hands on heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car
Nothing quite like the feel of something new

Maybe Im all messed up
Maybe Im all messed up
Maybe Im all messed up in you
Maybe Im all messed up
Maybe Im all messed up
Maybe Im all messed up in you
Maybe Im all messed up

This is the only time I really feel alive
I swear I just found everything I need
The sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me
Well I want to wrap it up and swim in it until I drown
My moral standing is lying down
Nothing quite like the feel of something new

Maybe Im all messed up
Maybe Im all messed up
Maybe Im all messed up in you
Maybe Im all messed up
Maybe Im all messed up
Maybe Im all messed up in you
Maybe Im all messed up

This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive

Maybe Im all messed up in you

This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive


10 Ringfinger

Well youve got me working so hard lately
Working my hands until they bleed
If I was twice the man I could be
Id still be half of what you need
Still you lead me and I follow
Anything you ask you know Ill do
This one act of consecration is what I ask of you


Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me

Well you just left me nailed here
Hanging like Jesus on his cross
Im just dying for your sins
And aiding to the cause



Wrap my eyes in bandages
Confessions I see through
I get everything I want
When I get part of you



Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Devils flesh and bone
Do something for me


its still getting worse after everything I tried
what if I found a way to wash it all aside
what if she touches with those fingertips
as the words spill out like fire from her lips

if she says come inside ill come inside for her
if she says five it all ill give everything to her
I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
inside you

Heavens just a rumor shell dispel
as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell
I still dream of lips I never should have never kissed
well she knows exactly what I cant resist

im just caught up in another of her spells
shes turning me into someone else
everyday I hope and pray this will end
but when I can I do it all again

as surely as the blades course is run
maybe my kingdoms finally come

I cant believe that what I feel is really happening to me
make it hurt and point the finger at my insecurities
well I guess I just dont understand
about those complexities in your mind
and I guess I just dont understand
why this world seems so unkind

maybe maybe just once I get whats coming
maybe maybe just once I get whats coming to me

so once again the way you feel
will never ever stay the same and im to blame
I wonder just who made the rules up for this game
well I guess I just dont understand
about what you want and what you need
and I guess I just dont understand
about how it has to be

you sat down on this bed and you said
"Christ what the hell do you think this place is"
you know he just couldnt believe it! and I said
"I dont know but it sure is something different"

so go ahead
you say those thousand things you think you have to say
look at me
and tell me loves not such a hard word anyway
well how can you count on me I thought you realized for sure
and how can you just believe
I thought I deserved just a little more

oh God
oh whats coming to me

im drunk
and right now im so in love with you
and I dont want to think too much
about what we should or shouldnt do
lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars
while the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car

nothing quite like the feel of something new
maybe im all messed up
maybe im all messed up in you
this is the only time I really feel alive

I swear
I just found everything I need
the sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me
well I want to drink it up and swim in it until I drown
my moral standing is lying down

nothing quite like the feel of something new
maybe im all messed up
maybe im all messed up in you
this is the only time I really feel alive

I cant help thinking Christ never had it like this


I cant shake this feeling from my head
theres a devil sleeping in my bed
hes watching you from across the way
I cannot make this feeling go away

I know its not the right thing
and I know its not the good think
but kinda I want to

im not sure of what I should do
when everything im think of is you
all of my excuses turn to lies
maybe God will cover up his eyes

I know its not the right thing
and I know its not the good think
but kinda I want to

maybe just for tonight
we can pretend its alright
whats the price I pay
I dont care what they say
I want to
I want to ill take my chance tonight



just when everything was making sense
you took away all my self-confidence
now all that ive been hearing must be true
I guess im not the only boy for you

but thats what I get
thats what I get
thats what I get
thats what I get

how could you turn us into this
after you just taught me how to kiss you
I told you id never say goodbye
now im slipping on the tears you made me cry

to think that I was so naive
maybe didnt mean so much
but it meant everything to me

ill stick it in your head
I wish I could remember everything she said

purest feeling
purest feeling
well she can be my savior with everything she does
or some kind of punishment for people just like us
I dont really believe she understands whats happening to me
the sooner that she gets it the better it will be

purest feeling
purest feeling
I have got it figured out I should have known all along
I cant live without her
purest feeling
I have got it figured out

well youve got me working so hard lately
working my hands until they bleed
if I was twice the man I could be
id still be half of what you need
still you lead me and I follow
all of your back up to your chin
over to the tip of your switchblade
as you pull it out and stick it in

Twist Twist Twist we can go a little deeper
Twist Twist Twist im wearing these chains
Twist Twist Twist you make it hurt real good
Twist Twist Twist I love the pain

and aiding to the cause

slave screams he thinks he knows what he wants
slave screams thinks he has something to say
slave screams he hears but doesnt want to listen
slave screams hes being beat into submission
dont open your eyes you wont like what you see
the devils of truth steal the souls of the free
dont open your eyes take it from me
i have found
you can find
happiness is slavery
slave screams he spends his life learning conformity
slave screams he claims he has his own identity
slave screams hes going to cause the system to fall
slave screams but hes glad to be chained to that wall
dont open your eyes you wont like what you see
the blind have been blessed with security
dont open your eyes take it from me
i have found
you can find
happiness is slavery
i dont know what i am i dont know where ive been
human junk just words and so much skin
stick my hands thru the cage of this endless routine
just some flesh caught in this big broken machine

perfect little dream the kind that hurts the most
forgot how it feels well almost
no one to blame always the same
open my eyes wake up in flames
it took you to make me realize
it took you to make me realize
it took you to make me realize
it took you to make me see the light
smashed up my sanity
smashed up my integrity
smashed up what i believed in
smashed up whats left of me
smashed up my everything
smashed up all that was true
gonna smash myself to pieces
i dont know what else to do
covered in hope and vaseline
still cannot fix this broken machine
watching the hole it used to be mine
just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline
of the trust i will betray
give it to me i throw it away
after everything ive done i hate myself for what ive become
i tried
i gave up
throw it away



I wanna take you baby
I wanna take you out
I wanna wine and dine you
Oh I wanna twist and twist and shout
I want you hot in my arms
So soft on my bed
You get the key to my heart
Oh when you wear that sweet dress

But youre too physical physical to me
Youre just too physical physical no to me

I want your rough house baby
I want this right in your ear
You let me feel your danger
I let you make this feeling clear here
I want the touch of your charms
The heat of your breath
I wanna say all those things
That would be better unsaid
No

But youre too physical physical to me
Youre just too physical oh
Youre too physical for me
Youre too physical to me
Youre really jus- just too- just
Too really fuck no

Youre just too physical 
Too fucking physical
No 
Oh youre too physical
Just too physical
Just too

There is no god up in the sky tonight
No sign of heaven anywhere in sight
All that was true is left behind
Once I could see now I am blind
Dont want your dreams you try to sell
This disease I give to myself

How does it feel 
She makes it sweeter than the sun
I get too tight I come undone
I bow my head to confess
The temple walls are made of flesh
Runs up my arms til Im on track
Itches my skin right off of my back
Ill heal your wounds
Ill set you free
Im Jesus Christ on Ecstacy

How does it feel 
I am so dirty on on the inside

How does it feel

Suck 

A thousand lips a thousand tongues
A thousand throats a thousand lungs
A thousand ways to make it true
I want to do terrible things to you

perfect little dream the kind that hurts the most
forgot how it feels well almost
no one to blame always the same
open my eyes wake up in flames

it took you to make me realize
it took you to make me see the light

smashed up my sanity
smashed up my integrity
smashed up what I believed in
smashed up whats left of me
smashed up my everything
smashed up all that was true

gonna smash myself to pieces
I dont know what else to do

he sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see
he tries to tell me what I put inside of me
hes got the answers to ease my curiosity
he dreamed up a god and called it Christianity
your god is dead and no one cares
if there is a hell I will see you there
he flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
he made a virus that would kill off all the swine
his perfect kingdom of killing suffering and pain
demands devotion atrocities done in his name
your god is dead and no one cares
drowning in his own hypocrisy
and if there is a hell I will see you there
burning with your god in humility
will you die for this

through every forest above the trees
within my stomach scraped off my knees
I drink the honey inside your hive
you are the reason I stay alive


you had all of them on your side didnt you
you believe in all your lies didnt you
the ruiners got a lot to prove hes got nothing to lose and now he made you
believe
the ruiners your only friend well hes the living end to the cattle he
deceives
the raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease
how did you get so big
how did you get so strong
how did you get so hard
how did you get so long
you had to give them all a sign didnt you
you had to covet what was mine didnt you
the ruiners a collector hes an infector serving his shit to his flies
maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly
realize
maybe its a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go
and maybe that fucked me up so much more than youll ever know
how did you get so big
how did you get so strong
how did you get so hard
how did you get so long
what you gave to me
my perfect ring of scars
you know I can see what you really are
you didnt hurt me nothing can hurt me
you didnt hurt me nothing can stop me now


I beat my machine its a part of me its inside of me
Im stuck in this dream its changing me I am becoming
the me that you know had some second thoughts
hes covered with scabs and he is broken and sore
the me that you know doesnt come around much
that part of me isnt here anymore
all pain disappears its the nature of my circuitry
drowns out all I hear theres no escape from this my new consciousness
that me that you know used to have feelings
but the blood has stopped pumping and hes left to decay
the me that you know is now made up of wires
and even when Im right with you Im so far away
I can try to get away but Iíve strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all my bad parts
I dont want to listen but its all too clear

hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid
Annie hold a little tighter I might just slip away

it wont give up it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head


Im losing ground
you know how this world can beat you down
Im made of clay
I fear Im the only one who thinks this way
Im always falling down the same hill
bamboo puncturing this skin
and nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall Im drowning in
2 feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
and if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
dont you tell me how I feel
dont you tell me how I feel
dont you tell me how I feel
you dont know just how I feel
I stay inside my bed
I have lived so many lives all in my head
dont tell me that you care
there really isnt anything is there
you would know wouldnt you
you extend your hand to those who suffer
to those who know what it really feels like
to those whove had a taste
like that means something
and oh so sick I am
and maybe I dont have a choice
and maybe that is all I have
and maybe this is a cry for help
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
dont you tell me how I feel
dont you tell me how I feel
dont you tell me how I feel
you dont know just how I feel

I want to know everything
I want to be everywhere
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters



I am a big man
yes I am
and I have a big gun
got me a big old Dick and I
I like to have fun
held against your forehead
Ill make you suck it
maybe Ill put a hole in your head
you know just for the fuck of it
I can reduce you if I want
I can devour
Im hard as fucking steel and Iíve got the power
Im every inch a man and Ill show you somehow
me and my fucking gun
nothing can stop me now
shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot
Im going to come all over you
me and my fucking gun

taste you
fuck you
use you
scar you
break you
lose me
hate me
smash me
erase me



she spread herself wide open to let the insects in
she leaves a trail of honey to show me where shes been
she has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
seeds from a thousand others drip down from within
oh my beautiful liar
oh my precious whore
my disease my infection
I am so impure
devils speak of the ways in which shell manifest
angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness
I now know the depths I reach are limitless
oh my beautiful liar
oh my precious whore
my disease my infection
I am so impure


he couldnt believe how easy it was
he put the gun into his face
bang!
so much blood from such a tiny little hole

problems have solutions
a lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash

everythings blue
in this world
the deepest shade of mushroom blue
all fuzzy
spilling out of my head

I hurt myself today
to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
the only thing thats real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but I remember everything
what have I become
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear my crown of shit
on my liars chair
full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
beneath the stain of time
the feeling disappears
you are someone else
I am still right here
what have I become
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
if I could start again
a million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way



This world rejects me
This world threw me away
This world never gave me a chance
This world gonna have to pay

Well I dont believe in your institutions
I did what you wanted me to
And like the cancer in your system
Ive got a little surprise for you

Something inside of me
Has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there
Did you not realise
This thing inside of me
It screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could

Burn

I look down at where youre standing
Flock of sheep all on display
With all your lies piled up around you
I can take it all away

Something inside of me
Has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there
Did you not realise
This thing inside of me
It screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could

Im gonna burn this whole world down

I never was a part of you

I am your savior
I am corruption
I am the angel
Of your destruction
I am perversion
Secret desire
I am your future
Swallowed up in fire


Someone take these dreams away
that point me to another day
A duel of personalities
that stretch all true reality

They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me

When figures from the past stand tall
and mocking voices ring the hall
Imperialistic house of prayer
conquistadors who took their share

They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me

Calling me Calling me

They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me

Im getting closer
Im getting closer
Im getting closer
Im getting closer
All the time
Im getting closer
All the time
Im getting closer
Im getting closer
All the time
Im getting closer
Im getting closer
Im getting closer
Im getting closer
Im getting closer
I tried to get so high
I made it 10 miles high
Im gonna get so high
Im gonna get so high
Youll never get inside
I swore Id never turn into you
Im going to all the time
I made it 10 miles high
If youre not truthfull Im not a lie
I swore to god I would never turn into you
Im getting closer
All the time
Tear it all down


its still getting worse after everything i tried
what if i found a way to wash it all aside
what if she touches with those fingertips
as the words spill out like fire from her lips


if she says come inside ill come inside for her
if she says give it all ill give everything to her
i am justified
i am purified
i am sanctified
inside you

Heavens just a rumor shell dispel
as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell
i still dream of lips i never should have never kissed
well she knows exactly what i cant resist



i think we should get in the front right now
get in the front right now!
doesnt that feel good
now youre ready to go get it
now i want you to get in there and get the job done
life is great!
life is terrific!
thank you God for another wonderful day!

im still caught up in another of her spells
well shes turning me into someone else
everyday i hope and pray this will end
but when i can i do it all again

and if she says come inside ill come inside for her
if she says give it all ill give everything to her
i am justified
i am purified
i am sanctified
inside you
i am purified
i am terrified
i am sanctified
inside you

even when its bowling shapes and see your life begin to change


i cant believe that what i feel is really happening to me
make it hurt
and point the finger at my insecurities
well i guess i just dont understand about those complexities in your mind
and i guess i just dont understand why this world seems so unkind


maybe maybe just once i get whats coming
maybe maybe just once i get whats coming to me

so once again the way you feel will never ever stay the same
and im to blame
i wonder just who made the rules up for this game
well i guess i just dont understand about what you want and what you need
and i guess i just dont understand about how it has to be



you sat down on this bed and you said
"Christ what the hell do you think this place is"
you know
he just couldnt believe it!
and i said
"i dont know but it sure is something different"

so go ahead
you say those thousand things you think you have to say
look at me
and tell me loves not such a hard word anyway
well how can you count on me i thought you realized for sure
and how can you just believe
i thought i deserved just a little more



oh God
oh whats coming to me

im drunk
and right now im so in love with you
and i dont want to think too much about what we should or shouldnt do
lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars
while the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car


nothing quite like the feel of something new
maybe im all messed up
maybe im all messed up
maybe im all messed up in you
maybe im all messed up
maybe im all messed up
maybe im all messed up
maybe im all messed up in you
maybe im all messed up
this is the only time i really feel alive
this is the only time i really feel alive

i swear
i just found everything i need
the sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me
well i want to wrap it up and swim in it until i drown
my moral standing is lying down



i cant shake this feeling from my head
theres a devil sleeping in my bed
watching you from across the way
i cannot make this feeling go away


i know its not the right thing
and I know its not the good think
but kinda i want to

im not sure of what i should do
when every thought im thinking of is you
all of my excuses turn to lies
maybe God will cover up his eyes



why does it have to be this way
why does it have to be
why does have to be this way

kinda i want to
maybe just for tonight
we can pretend its alright
whats the price i pay
i dont care what they say
i want to
i want to ill take my chance tonight

just when everything was making sense
you took away all my self-confidence
now all that ive been hearing must be true
i guess im not the only boy for you


but thats what i get
thats what i get
thats what i get
thats what i get

how could you turn us into this
after you just taught me how to kiss you
i told you id never say goodbye
im slipping on the tears you made me cry

but thats what i get
thats what i get
thats what i get
thats what i get
for trusting you
thats what i get

why does it come as a surprise
to think that i was so naive
maybe didnt mean too much
but it meant everything to me


purest feeling
purest feeling
well i think im gonna push it as far as it will go
give in to desire
only you will know
so tell me all your secrets
ill stick it in your head
i wish i could remember everything she said

purest feeling
purest feeling
purest feeling
purest feeling
well she can be my savior with everything she does
or some kind of punishment for people just like us
i dont really believe she understands whats happening to me
the sooner that she gets it the better it will be

purest feeling
purest feeling
purest feeling
purest feeling
purest feeling
i have got it figured out i should have known all along
i cant live without her
purest feeling
i have got it figured out



well youve got me working so hard lately
working my hands until they bleed
if i was twice the man i could be
id still be half of what you need
still you lead me and i follow
all of your back up to your chin
over to the tip of your switchblade as you pull it out and stick it in


TwistTwistTwist we can go a little deeper
TwistTwistTwist im wearing these chains
TwistTwistTwist you make it hurt real good
TwistTwistTwist i love the pain

well you just leave me nailed here
hanging like Jesus on the cross
im just dying for your sins
and aiding to the cause



wrap my soul in bandages
im tired of this war
go ahead and cut me
i cant even feel it anymore


wimp wimp

kinda like a cloud i was up way up in the sky
and i was feeling some feelings you wouldnt believe
sometimes i dont believe them myself and i decided i was never coming down

just then a tiny little dot caught my eye
it was just about too small to see
but i watched it way too long
that dot was pulling me down


i was up above it
i was up above it
i was up above it
i was up above it
now im down in it

shut up
so what what does it matter now
i was swimming in the hate now i crawl on the ground
and everything i never liked about you is kind of seeping into me
i try to laugh about it now but isnt it funny how everything works out
i guess the jokes on me



i used to be so big and strong
i used to know my right from wrong
i used to never be afraid
i used to be somebody

i used to have something inside
now just this hole its open wide
used to want it all
i used to be somebody

ill cross my heart and hope to die
but the needles already in my eye
and all the worlds weight is on my back and i dont even know why
and what i used to think was me is just a fading memory
i looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye"



rain rain go away
come again some other day



na na na na na na na na


I got my head but my head is unraveling
cant keep control cant keep track of where its traveling
I got my heart but my hearts no good
youre the only one thats understood

I come along but I dont know where youre taking me
I shouldnt go but youre wrenching dragging shaking me
turn off the sun pull the stars from the sky
the more I give to you the more I die

and I want you

you are the perfect drug
the perfect drug
the perfect drug
the perfect drug

you make me hard when im all soft inside
I see the truth when im all stupid-eyed
the arrow goes straight through my heart
without you everything just falls apart

my blood just wants to say hello to you
my fear is warm to get inside of you
my soul is so afraid to realize
how every little bit is left of me

take me with you
without you everything just falls apart
its not as much fun to pick up the pieces


so impressed with all you do
tried so hard to be like you
flew too high and burnt the wing
lost my faith in everything

lick around divine debris
taste the wealth of hate in me
shedding skin succumb defeat
this machine is obsolete

made the choice to go away
drink the fountain of decay
tear a hole exquisite red
fuck the rest and stab it dead

broken bruised forgotten sore
too fucked up to care anymore
poisoned to my rotten core
too fucked up to care anymore

in the back off the side far away is a place where I hide where I
stay tried to say tried to ask I needed to all alone by myself where were you
how could I ever think its funny how everything that
swore it wouldnt change is different now just like you
would always say well make it through then my head fell apart and where were you
how could I ever think its funny how everything you swore would
never change is different now like you said you and me make it
through didnt quite fell apart where the fuck were you

Id listen to the words hed say
but in his voice I heard decay
the plastic face forced to portray
all the insides left cold and gray
there is a place that still remains
it eats the fear it eats the pain
the sweetest price hell have to pay
the day the whole world went away


just a reflection
just a glimpse
just a little reminder
of all the what abouts
and all the might have
could have beens
another day
some other way
but not another reason to continue
and now youre one of us
the wretched

the hopes and prays
the better days
the far aways
forget it

it didnt turn out the way you wanted it to
it didnt turn out the way you wanted it to did it
it didnt turn out the way you wanted it to
it didnt turn out the way you wanted it to did it

now you know
this is what it feels like
now you know
this is what it feels like

the clouds will part and the sky cracks open
and god himself will reach his fucking arm through
just to push you down
just to hold you down
stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss
and its hard to believe it could come down to thisback at the beginning
sinking
spinning

and in the end
we still pretend
the time we spend
not knowing when
youre finally free
and you could be

but it didnt turn out the way you wanted it to
it didnt turn out quite the way that you wanted it

now you know
this is what it feels like
now you know
this is what it feels like

you can try to stop it but it keeps on coming
you can try to stop it but



Ive become impossible
holding on to when
when everything seemed to matter more
the two of us
all used and beaten up
watching fate as it flow down the path we
have chose

you and me
were in this together now
none of them can stop us now
we will make it through somehow
you and me
if the world should break in two
until the very end of me
until the very end of you

awake to the sound as they peel apart the skin
they pick and they pull
trying to get their fingers in
well theyve got to kill what weve found
well theyve got to hate what we fear
well theyve got to make it go away
well theyve got to make it disappear

the farther I fall Im beside you
as lost as I get I will find you
the deeper the wound Im inside you
for ever and ever Im a part of

you and me
were in this together now
none of them can stop us now
we will make it through somehow
you and me
if the world should break in two
until the very end of me
until the very end of you

all that we were is gone we have to hold on
all that we were is gone we have to hold on
when all our hope is gone we have to hold on
all that we were is gone but we can hold on

you and me
were in this together now
none of them can stop us now
we will make it through somehow
you and me
even after everything
youre the queen and Im the king
nothing else means anything

she shines
in a world full of ugliness
she matters when everything is meaningless

fragile
she doesnt see her beauty
she tries to get away
sometimes
its just that nothing seems worth saving
I cant watch her slip away

I wont let you fall apart

she reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
hoping someone can see
if I could fix myseld Id - but its too late for me

I wont let you fall apart

well find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide
Ill build a wall and we can keep them on the other side
but they keep waiting
and picking

its something I have to do
I was there too
before everyhting else
I was like you

I woke up today
to find myself in the other place
with a trail of footprints
from where I ran away
it seems everything Ive heard
just might be true
and you know me
well you think you do
sometimes I have everything - yet I wish I felt something

do you know how far this has gone
just how damaged have I become
when I think I can overcome
it runs even deeper

and in a dream Im a different me
with a perfect you
we fit perfectly
and for once in my life I feel complete
and I still want to ruin it
afraid to look
as clear as day
this plan has long been underway

I hear them call
I cannot stay
the voice inviting me away

do you know how far this has gone
just how damaged have I become
when I think I can overcome
it runs even deeper
everything that matters is gone
all the hands of hope have withdrawn
could you try to help me hang on
it runs

I straight
I wont crack
on my way
and I cant turn back
Im okay
Im on track
on my way
and I cant turn back
I stayed
on this track
gone too far
and I cant come back
I stayed
on this track
lost my way
cant come back


smiling in thier faces
while filling up the hole
so many dirty little places
in your filthy little worn out
broken down see through soul

babys got a problem
tries so hard to hide
got to keep it on the surface
because everything else is dead on the other side

teeth in the necks of everyone you know
you can keep on sucking until the blood wont flow
when it starts to hurt it only helps it grow
taking all you need
but not this time
no you dont

and just for the record
just so you know
I did not believe
that you could sink so low

you think that you can beat them
I know that you wont
you think you have everything
but no you dont

no you dont
no you dont
no you dont
no you dont


and when the day arrives
Ill become the sky
and Ill become the sea

and the sea will come to kiss me
for I am going home

nothing can stop me now



staring at the sea
will she come
is there hope for me
after all is said and done
anything at any price
all of this for you
all the spoils of a wasted life
all of this for you
all the world has closed her eyes
tried faith all worn and thin
for all we could have done
and all that could have been

ocean pulls me close
and whispers in my ear
the destiny Ive chose
all becoming clear
the currents have their say
the time is drawing near
washes me away
makes me disappear

I descend from grace
in arms of undertow
I will take my place
in the geat below

I can still feel you
even so far away



all Ive undergone
I will keep on

underneath it all
we feel so small
the heavens fall
but still we crawl

all Ive undergone
I will keep on


tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

talking to myself all the way to the station
pictures in my head of the final destination all lined up
all the ones that arent allowed to stay
tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches
tried to overcome the complications and the catches
nothing ever grows and the sun doesnt shine all day
tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away


did you happen to catch
or did it happen so fast
what you thought would always last
has passed you by
is everything speeding up
or am I slowing down
just spinning around
and I dont know why
all the pieces dont fit
thought I didnt give a shit
I never wanted to be like you
but for all I aspire
I am really a liar
and Im running out of things I can do

Id like to stay
but every day
everything pushes me further away
if you couls show
help me to know
how its supposed to be
where did it go

pleading and
needing and
bleeding and
breeding and
feeding
exceeding
where is everybody
trying and lying
defying denying
crying and dying
where is everybody

well okay enough
youve had your fun
but come on thare has to be someone
that hasnt yet become
so numb and succumb
and god damn I am so tired of pretending
of wishing I was ending
when all Im really doing is trying to hide
and keep it inside
and fill it with lies
open my eyes
maybe I wish I could try

pleading and needing
and bleeding and breeding
and feeding exceeding
where is everybody
trying and lying
defying denying
crying and dying
where is everybody

this is how
it begins
push it away but it all comes back again
all the flesh
all the sin
there was a time when it used to mean just about everything

just like now

breathe echoing the sound
time starts slowing down
sink until I drown
please I dont ever want to make it stop

and it keeps repeating
will you please complete me

never be enough
to fill me up

watch the white
turn to red
it fills up the hole but it grows somewhere else instead
all my life
yeah yeah yeah yeah but it just left me dead
well guess what
the world is over and I realize it was all in my head

now everything is clear
I erase the fear
I can disappear
please I dont ever want to make it stop

you can never leave me
will you pleaseb complete me

never be enough
to fill me up

my god sits in the back of the limousine
my god comes in a wrapper of cellophane
my god pouts on the cover of the magazine
my gods a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene

I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype
I listened to everyone now I know that everyone was right
Ill be there for you as long as it works for me
I play a game
its called insincerity

starfuckers
starfuckers
starfuckers inc
starfuckers

I am every fucking thing and just a little more
I sold my soul but dont you dare call me a whore
and when I suck you off not a drop will go to waste
its really not so bad you know once you get past the taste yeah
asskisser

starfuckers

starfuckers

all our pain
how did we ever get by without you
youre so vain
I bet you think this song is about you
dont you
dont you
dont you
dont you

now I belong Im one of the chosen ones
now I belong Im one of the beautiful ones

as black as the night can get
everything is safer now
theres always a way to forget
once you learn to find a way how

in the blur of serenity
where did everything get lost
the flowers of naivete
buried in a layer of frost

the smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes

thought he had it all before they called his bluff
found out that his skin just wasnt thick enough
wanted to go back to how it was before
thought he lost everything
then he lost a whole lot more

a fools devotion
swallowed up in empty space
the tears of regret
frozen to the side of his face

the smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes

Ive done all I can do
could I please come with you
sweet smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes



there is a game I play
try to make myself okay
try so hard to make the pieces all fit
smash it apart
just for the fuck of it

bye bye oooh
got to get back to the bottom
bye bye oooh
the big come down isnt that what you wanted
bye bye oooh
find a place with the failed and forgotten
bye bye oooh
isnt that really what you wanted now

there is no place I can go there is no way I can hide
it feels like it keeps coming from the inside

there is a hate that burns within
the most desperate place I have ever been
try to get back to where Im from
the closer I get the worse it becomes
the closer I get the worse it becomes

there is no place I can go there is no place I can hide
it feels like it keeps coming from the inside


all I do
I can still feel you

numb all through
I can still feel you
hear your call
underneath it all
kill my brain
yet you still remain
crucified
after all Ive died
after all Ive tried
you are still inside

all I do
I can still feel you

you remain
I am stained


Were in the building where they make us grow
And Im frightened by the liquid engineers
Like you
My Mallory heart is sure to fail
I could crawl around the floor just like Im real
Like you
The sound of metal I want to be you
I could learn to be a man
Like you
Plug me in and turn me on
Oh everything is moving
I need my treatment its tomorrow they send me
Singing "I am an American"
Do you
Picture this if they could make the change
Id love to pull the wires from the wall
Did you
And who are you and how can I try
Here inside I like metal
Dont you
All I know is no one dies
Im still confusing love with need

I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head till I dont want to sleep anymore

Come on tell me
Make this all go away
You make this all go away
Im down to just one thing
And Im starting to scare myself
Make this all go away
You make this all go way
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldnt do the things that I can do now
This is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart

I just want something I can never have

In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now I know its still the same
Everywhere I look youre all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be

Come on tell me
Make this all go away
You make this all go away
Im down to just one thing
And Im starting to scare myself
Make this all go away
You make this all go way

I just want something
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have

Think I know what you meant
That night on my bed
Still picking at this scab
I wish you were dead
You sweet and Perry Ellis
Just stains on my sheets

I beat my machine its a part of me its inside of me
Im stuck in this dream its changing me I am becoming

The me the you know he had some second thoughts
Hes covered with scabs he is broken and sore
The me that you know he doesnt come around much
That part of me isnt here anymore

All pain disappears its the nature of my circuitry
Drowns out all I hear no escape from this my new consciousness

The me that you know he used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping and hes left to decay
The me that you know is now made up of wires
And even when Im right with you Im so far away

I can try to get away but Ive strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all of my bad parts
I dont want to listen but its all to clear

Hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid
Annie hold a little tighter I might just slip away

It wont give up it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head

watching all the insects march along
seem to know just right where they belong
smears a face reflecting in the chrome
hiding in the crowd Im all alone

no ones heard a single word Ive said
they dont sound this good outside my head
it looks as though the past is here to stay
Ive become a million miles a

why do you get all the love in the world 

all the jagged edges disappear
colors all look brighter when youre near
the stars are all afire in the sky
sometimes I get so lonely I could

why do you get all the love in the world 

I tried to send myself through -- tried to get to the other side
I had to patch up the cracks and the holes that I have to hide
found a little bit of time even made it work okay
just found enough to make it really hurt
when they figured me out and it all just rotted away

dont you fucking know what you are
you all get back to where you belong

you better take a good luck because Im full of shit
dont rebuild my heart I dont try to believe in it
you can push it all out -- you can try to pretend
but you cant change anything -- you cant change anything in the end

dont you fucking know what you are
you all get back to where you belong
dont you fucking know what you are

remember what you are
remember where you came from

dont you fucking know what you are
you all get back to where you belong

I pick things up I am a collector
and things well things tend to accumulate
I have this net it drags behind me collecting feelings for me to feed upon

there are times plenty of times I wish I could let it go
Its time to breathe and its time to grow inside me
there are times plenty of times I wish I could let it go

but this time too many to think things I dont want no

Im trying to fit it all inside
Im trying the whole thing on my plate
Im trying not to choke and swallow it all swallow it all swallow it all swallow it all

I am the pig
I am the swarm
all your heart sticks on me and Im keepin it raw
they will make me stay
they wont let me leave
there are so goddamn many of them it gets so hard to breathe

Im trying to fit it all inside
Im trying the whole thing on my plate
Im trying not to choke inside
I am a big boy and I will swallow it all swallow it all swallow it all swallow it all

Every last one

youre keeping in step in the line
got your chin held high and you feel just fine
cause you do what youre told
but inside your heart it is black it is hollow and its cold

just how deep do you believe
will you bite the hand that feeds
will you chew until it bleeds
can you get up off you knees
are you brave enough to see
do you want to change it

what if this whole crusades a charade
and behind it all is a price to be paid
for the blood on which we dine
justified in name of the holy and the divine

just how deep do you believe
will you bite the hand that feeds
will you chew until it bleeds
can you get up off you knees
are you brave enough to see
do you want to change it

so naive
i keep holding on to what i want to believe
i can see
but i keep holding on and on and on and on and on

will you bite the hand that feeds you
will you stay down on your knees
will you bite the hand that feeds

the more that we take
the paler we get
i cant remember what it is
we try to forget
the towel on the floor
so cold it could sting
in your eyes is a place worth remembering
for you to go and take this and smash it apart
Ive gone all this fucking way
to wind up back at -- back at the start

hey the closer we think we are
well it only got us so far
now ve you anything left to show
no no i didnt think so
hey the sooner we realise
we cover ourselves with lies
but underneath were not so tough
and love is not enough

well it hides in the dark
like the withering vein
we didnt give it a mouth
so it could not complain
you never really had a chance
well never really make it through
an everything i believe
i believed i could get better with you

hey the closer we think we are
well it never got us so far
now youve got anything left to show
no no no no i didnt think so
hey the sooner we realise
we cover ourselves with lies
but underneath were not so tough
and love is not enough

love is not enough
hey


i believe i can see the future
because i repeat the same routine
i think i used to have a purpose
then again that might have been a dream
i think i used to have a voice
now i never make a sound
and i just do what i have been told
i really dont want them to come around
oh no

every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same

i can feel their eyes are watching
in case i lose myself again
sometimes i think Im happy here
sometimes
sometimes yeah i still pretend
i cannot remember how this got started
oh but i can tell you exactly how it will end

every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same

Im writing on a little piece of paper
Im hoping someday you might find
well Ill hide it behind something they wont look behind
i am still inside
a little bit comes breathing through
i wish this couldve been any other way
but i just dont know i dont know what else i can do

every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same


she comes along
she gets inside
she makes you better than anything youve tried
consealed in her kiss
the blackest sea
and it runs deeper than you dare to dream it could be

wi-th tee-th

wave goodbye
to what you were
the roles are changed
the lines begin to blur
she you hard
it comes on strong
you finally found the place where you belong

wi-th tee-th

i cannot go through this again

wi-th tee-th

shell will not let you go
keeps holding on
this time Im not coming back
shell will not let you go


Im becoming less defined as days go by
fading away and well you might say Im losing focus
kind of drifting to the abstract in terms of how i see myself
sometimes i think i can see right through myself

less concerned about fitting into the world
youre world that is
cause it doesnt really matter anymore
none of this sh

and yes i am alone then again i always was
as far back as i can tell i think maybe its because
you were never really real to begin with
i just made you up to hurt myself
yeah i just made you up to hurt myself
and it worked yes it did

there is no you
there is only me
there is no fucking you
there is only me

only

well the tiniest little dot caught my eye
and it turned to be a scab
and i had this funny feeling like i just knew its something bad
i just couldnt leave it alone picking at this scab
it was a doorway trying to seal itself shut but i climbed through

no Im somewhere i am not supposed to be
and i can see things i know i really shouldnt see
and now i know why n-now i know why
things arent as pretty on the inside

there is no you
there is only me
there is no fucking you
there is only me

only


getting a little erratic here
and i dont know who to trust
i guess they got a way of reading my mind
i guess Ive got to adjust
Ive got my arms that flip flop flip flop flip
i got my hair on a spring
well i thought i got you on my side
i havent got fucking anything

Im just a face in the crowd
nothing to worry about
not even try to stand out
Im getting smaller and smaller and smaller
and Ive got nothing to say
its all been taken away
i just behave and obey
Im afraid Im starting to fade away

uh huh

i cannot see through the cracks
when i was up on the wall
Im not looking to stand up real high
Id be happy to crawl
i think Im losing my grip
but i can still make a fist
you know Ive still got my one good arm
and i can mmm i can beat myself for this

Im just a face in the crowd
nothing to worry about
not even try to stand out
Im getting smaller and smaller and smaller
and Ive got nothing to say
its all been taken away
i just behave and obey
Im afraid that Im starting to fade away

hey and for what it is worth
i used to really believe
but maybe thats some great thing
that we could achieve
and now i cant tell the difference
dont know what to feel
between what Ive been trying so hard to see
and what appears to be real

Im fading away

my world is getting smaller every day and thats okay


sunspots cast a glare in my eyes
sometimes i forget Im alive
i feel it coming and Ive got to get out of his way
i hear it calling and i come because i cant disobey
i should not listen and i should not believe but i do

she turns me on
she makes it real
i have to apologize for the way i feel

my life it seems has taken a turn
why in the name of god would i ever want to return
peel off our skin were gonna burn what we were to the ground
fuck in the fire and well spread all the ashes around
i want to kill all the rest of whats left and i do

she turns me on
she makes it real
i have to apologize for the way i feel

and nothing can stop me now
there is nothing to fear
and everything Id ever want
is inside of here

no no no no inside of here
now i just stare into the sun
and i see everything Ive done
i think i could have been someone
but i cant stop what has begun
when everything is said and done
and there is no place left to run
i think i used to be someone
and now i just stare into the sun


there are things that i said i would never do
there are fears that i cannot believe will come true
so my soul is too sick and too little not too late
and myself i have grown too weary to mate

the more i stay in here
the more its not so clear
the more i stay in here
the more i disappear
as far as i have gone
i knew what side Im on
but now Im not so sure
the line begins to blur

is there somebody on top of me
i dont know i dont know
isnt anyone stopping me
i dont know i dont know
why am i trying to hold my breath
i dont know i dont know
just how far down can i go
i dont know i dont know i dont know

as i lie here in still
the fabric starts to tear
its far beyond repair
and i dont even care
as far as i have gone
i knew what side Im on
but now Im not so sure
the line begins to blur



i am all alone this time around
sometimes on my side i hear a sound
places parallel i know its you
feel the little pieces bleeding through

and on this goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
this goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

now that Ive decided not to stay
i can feel me start to fade away
everything is back where it belong
i will be beside you before long

and on this goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
this goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

we will never die
beside you in time



see the animal in his cage that you built
are you sure what side youre on
better not look him too closely in the eye
are you sure what side of the glass youre on

see the safety of the life you have built
everything where it belongs
feel the hollowness inside of your heart
and its all right where it belongs

what if everything around you isnt quite what it seems
what if all the world you think you know is an elaborate dream
and if you look at your reflection is that all you want to be
what if you could look right through the crack
would you find yourself find yourself afraid to see

what if all the worlds inside of your head
just creations of your own
your devils and your gods and the living and the dead
and you really are alone
you can live in this illusion
you can choose to believe
you keep looking but you cant find words
are you hiding in the trees

what if everything around you isnt quite what as seems

what if all the world you used to know is an elaborate dream
and if you look at your reflection is that all you want to be
what if you could look right through the cracks
would you find yourself find yourself afraid to see


Everything
Is catching up with me
I awake
To find Im not at all where I
Should be
And it feels
Im getting to the end
And its hard
To figure out whats real
And whats
Pretend

To break from what
Were tied to
God knows
How much Ive tried to

And I am still inside you
And I am still inside you

I escape
Every now and then
And to think
I find myself
Back here again
And again

I used to know who I was
Untill you came along
I return
To the only place
Ive ever felt
That I belong

To break from what
Were tied to
God knows
How much Ive tried to

And I am still inside you
And I am still inside you


Hyperpower!
Hyperpower!
Hyperpower!
Hyperpower!



Down on your knees youll be left behind
This is the beginning
Watch what you think they can read your mind
This is the beginning
I got my mark see it in my eyes
This is the beginning
My reflection I dont recognize
This is the beginning

We think we climb so high
All up the backs weve condemned
We face our consequence
This is the beginning of the end

You wait your turn youll be last in line
This is the beginning
Get out the way cause Im getting mine
This is the beginning
God helps the ones that help themselves
This is the beginning
May be too late as far as I can tell
This is the beginning

We think weve come so far
On all our lies we depend
We face our consequence
This is the beginning of the end


I should have listened to her
So hard to keep control
We kept on eating but
Our bloated bellys still not full
She gave us all she had but
We went and took some more
Cant seem to shut her legs
Our mother nature is a whore


I got my propaganda
I got revisionism
I got my violence
In hi-def ultra-realism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist
I got my plan
I got survivalism

Hypnotic sound of sirens
Echoing through the street

The cocking of the rifles
The marching of the feet
You see your world on fire
Dont try to act surprised
We did just what you told us
Lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies



All bruised and broken bleeding
She asked to take my hand
I turned just keep on walking
But youd do the same thing in the circumstance
Im sure youll understand



You got your pacifism - I got survivalism

Gun fire in the street
Where we used to meet
Echos out a beat and the bass goes
Bomb right over my head
Step over the dead
Remember what you said you know the part about
Life is just a waking dream
I know what you mean
But that aint how it seems right here right now
How can all this be real
I can barely feel
Anymore

I am trying to see
I am trying to believe
This is not where I should be
I am trying to believe

Blood hardens in the sand
Cold metal in my hand
Maybe held you understand
The way that things will be
Theres nowhere else to hide
Cause god is on our side
I keep telling myself

I am trying to see
I am trying to believe
This is not where I should be
I am trying to believe

No ones even sure
What were fighting for
Or who we even are
Anymore
I feel
So far away


I let you put it in my mouth
I let it get under my skin
I let you pump it through my veins
I let you take me from within
They tell you what we can and cannot do
Same thing weve heard a hundred times before
When I put you inside of me
None of that matters anymore

My god
Can I go any faster
Oh my god
I cant think I can last here

I am you and you are me
We will never be alone
I have finally found my place in everything
I have finally found my home
I can leave all of this flesh behind
I can see right through this whole facade
I am becoming something else
I am turning into god

My god
Can I go any faster
Oh my god
I cant think I can last here


Well its happening
Never planned on this
Youve got something I need
Kind of dangerous
And Im losing control
Im not used to this
What you want from me
Im not used to this

I cant shut it off
This thing Ive begun
And its hard to tell
Just where its coming from
And its hard to see
What Im capable of
And its hard to believe
Just what Ive become

Hey can we stop
Me Im not
Hey can we stop
Me Im not
Hey can we stop
Me Im not
Hey can we stop
Me Im not

I can swallow it down
Keep it all inside
I define myself
By how well I hide
I feel it coming apart
Well at least I tried

I can win this war
By knowing not to fight
If I take it all back
Someway somehow
If I knew back then
What I know right now

Hey can we stop
Me Im not
Hey can we stop
Me Im not
Hey can we stop
Me Im not
Hey can we stop
Me Im not


I pushed a button and elected him to office and a
He pushed a button and it dropped a bomb
You pushed the button and could watch it on the television
Those motherfuckers didnt last too long ha ha
Im sick of hearing about the haves and the have nots
Have some personal accountability
The biggest problem with the way that weve been doing things is
The more we let you have the less that Ill be keeping for me

Well I used to stand for something
Now Im on my hands and knees
Traded in my god for this one
And he signs his name with a capital G

Dont give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala
Dont really see what all the fuss is about

Aint gonna worry about no future generations and a
Im sure somebody gonna figure it out
Dont try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person
You havent had enough to know what its like
Youre only angry cause you wish you were in my position
Now nod your head because you know that Im right alright!

Well I used to stand for something
But forgot what that could be
Theres a lot of me inside you
Maybe youre afraid to see

Well I used to stand for something
Now Im on my hands and knees
Traded in my god for this one
And he signs his name with a capital G


You and I we may look the same
But we are very far apart
Theres bullet holes where my compassion used to be
And there is violence in my heart
Into fire you can send us
From the fire we return
You can label us a consequence of how much you have to learn

You can try but youll never understand
This is something you will never understand
Can you hear it now
Hear it coming now
Can you hear it now

On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our bones our skin
We will not let you in

You have set something in motion
Much greater than youve ever known
Standing there in all your grand naivety
About to reap what you have sown
Time will feed upon your weaknesses
And soon youll lose the will to care
When you return to the place that you call home
We will be there we will be there

On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood will stain
We will not go away
On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood our ways will never leave this place


Some say it was a warning
Some say its a sign
I was standing right there
When it came down from the sky
The way it spoke to us
You felt it from inside
Said it was up to us
Up to us to decide
"youve become a virus
Killing off his host
We been watching you with all our eyes
And what you seem to value most
So much potential
Or so we used to say
Your greed self-importance and your arrogance
You piss it all away
We heard her cry
We have come to intervence
You will change your ways and you will make amends
Or we will wipe this place clean!"

Your time is ticking away




Hey man
Please dont make a sound
Take a look around
Cant you see whats right in front of you
Ah
Have a little taste
No more time to waste
You dont want to get left behind because its all coming down right now
Now - how
Hard is it to see
Put your faith in me
I sure wouldnt want to be
Praying to the wrong piece of wood
You should
Get where you belong
Everything you know is wrong
Come on sing along everybody now

god given
And he gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know were right
When his kingdom come
And thy will be done
We have just begun
Were the chosen ones

I would never tell you anything that wasnt absolutely true that hadnt come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you

Wait
Step into the light
How can this be right
Im afraid were going to ask you to leave
Guess you can not win
With the color of your skin
You wont be getting in to the promised land
Besides
This is just another case
You people still dont know your place
Step aside out the way wipe that look off your face
We are the devine
Separated from the swine
Come on sing along everybody now

god given
And he gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know were right
When his kingdom come
And thy will be done
We have just begun
Were the chosen ones
And he gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know were right
When his kingdom come
And thy will be done
And the father and the holy son
Were the chosen ones

I would never tell you anything that wasnt absolutely true that hadnt come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you




Bow down in position
Against the polished steel
This is something different
Youll like this way this feels
No time for asking questions
No time for wondering
Weve heard enough from you now
Weve heard everything
Were going to play a new game
Youll put on this blindfold
Youll do what we tell you
Youll do as your told
Used to be the leader
Now comes the time to serve
Maybe we show some mercy
Maybe you get what you deserve

Count down to the end
Gotta make it come faster faster
Right around the bend
Is a coming disaster
Count down to the end
And were headed there faster
Come on down my friend
Its time to meet your master

Youve left quite a mess here
Under your stewardship
You thought youd figured it out but
Youll learn your place in this
Might take some convincing
For you to see the truth
There are so many things
Weve got in store for you

Count down to the end
Gotta make it come faster faster
Right around the bend
Is a coming disaster
Count down to the end
And were headed there faster faster
Come on down my friend
Its time to meet your master



Breathe us in
Slowly
Slowly

Persuasion
Coercion
Submission
Assimilation

Welcome to your new point of view
We have disappeared into you

Everything you do
Everywhere you go
Anything you want
Anything

Now its all just a matter of time



Say your name
Try to speak as clearly as you can
You know everything gets written down
Nod your head
Just in case they could be watching
With their shiny satellites

I hope they cannot see
The limitless potential
Living inside of me
To murder everything
I hope they cannot see
I am the great destroyer

Turn it up
Listen to the shit they pump into
Your head
Filling you with apathy
Hold your breathe
Wait until you know the time is right
On time
The end is near

I hope they cannot see
The limitless potential
Living inside of me
I murder everything
I hope they cannot see
I am the great destroyer



Watch the sun
As it crawls across a final time
And it feels like
Like it was a friend
It is watching us
And the world we set on fire
Do you wonder
If it feels the same

And the sky is filled with light
Can you see it
All the black is really white
If you believe it
As your time is running out
Let me take away your doubt
You can find a better a place
In this twilight

From dust to dust
Ashes in your hair remind me
What it feels like
And I wont feel again
Night descends
Could I have been a better person
If I could only
Do it all again

And the sky is filled with light
Do you see it
All the black is really white
If you believe it
And the longing that you feel
You know none of this is real
You will find a better a place
In this twilight

And one little extra




Theyre starting to open up the sky
Theyre starting to reach down through
And it feel like were living in that split-second
Of a car crash
And time is slowing down
And if we only had a little more time
And this time
Is all there is
Do you remember the time we
And all the times we
And should have
And were going to
I know
And I know you remember
How we could justify it all
And we knew better
In our hearts we knew better
And we told ourselves it didnt matter
And we chose to continue
And none of this matters anymore
In the hour of our twilight
And soon it will be all said and done
And we will all be back together as one
If we will continue at all

Shame on us
Doomed from the start
May god have mercy
On our dirty little hearts
Shame on us
For all weve done
And all we ever were
Just zeros and ones

And you never get away
And you never get to take the easy way
And all of this is a consequence
Brought on by our own hand
If you believe in that sort of thing
And did you ever really find
When you closed your eyes
Any place that was still
And at peace
And I guess I just wanted to tell you
As the light starts to fade
That you are the reason
That I am not afraid
And I guess I just wanted to mention
As the heavens will fall
We will be together soon if we
Will be anything at all

Shame on us
Doomed from the start
May god have mercy
On our dirty little hearts
Shame on us
For all weve done
And all we ever were
Just zeros and ones

How did I slip into this




Kind of hard
Hard to see
When you crawl
On your hands and your knees
With your face
In the trough
Wait your turn
While they finish you off
Dont know when it started
Dont know how
Should have found out
Should have happened by now
Got these lines
On my face
After all this time
And I still havent found my place

I jump from every rooftop
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I dont feel any thing at all

I wake up
On the floor
Start it up again
Like it matters anymore
I dont know
If it does
Is this really all
That there ever was
Put the gun
In my mouth
Close your eyes
Blow my fucking brains out
Pretty patterns
On the floor
Thats enough for you
But I still need more

I jump from every rooftop
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I dont feel any thing at all


The sky is painted black
The smoke pours out the stack
One hand upon your heart
One hand behind your back
You train us how to act
You keep the fear intact
The imminent attack
Everything is right on track

And we are letting you get away
We are letting you get away with it

Upon our plates to feed
The dying left to bleed
How much we really need
Your politics of greed
The cancer takes a hold
The wolf is in the fold
Our destinys been sold
We do just
what were told

And we are letting you get away
We are letting you get away with it

Your armies filled with hate
Believing your charade
Begin to suffocate
For us its far too late

And we are letting you get away
We are letting you get away with it


Am I still tough enough
Feels like Im wearing down
Is my viciousness
Losing ground
Am I taking too much
Did I cross a line
I need my role in this
Very clearly defined
I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself

And now its starting up
feels like Im losing touch
Nothing matters to me
Nothing matters as much
I see you left a mark
Up and down my skin
I dont know where I end
And
where you begin
I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself
Once I start I cannot stop myself

Nice and high and far apart
Just like they said
I built this place with broken parts
Just like they said
You chip away the old version of you
Youd be surprised at what you can do
Im safe in here
Irrelevant
Just like they said

My voice just echoes off these walls

You feel me breathe
I am watching you
I see it all
The many ways you cant get to me
I see it all
I see the Hell you put yourself through
Oh the things I could do if I wanted to

My voice just echoes off these walls
My voice just echoes off these walls
I dont need anything at all

My voice just echoes off these walls

And I just slowly fade away

You will never ever get to me in here

You
What you looking at
Head down
Too late for that
What you want
What you get
Know your place
Dont ever forget

And this is not my face
And this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here
I can recognize
This is all a dream
And none of you are real
Ill give anything
Ill give anything

Hey you
What you running from
All your hate
What youve become
Bet you didnt think
It would happen to you
All used up
Half way through

And this is not my face
And this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here
I can recognize
This is all a dream
And none of you
are real
Ill give anything
Ill give anything

Shes mostly gone
Some other place
Im getting by
In other ways
Everything they whispered in our ear
Is coming true
Try to justify the things
They used to do
Believe in you

Watching you drown
Ill follow you down
I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Have finally arrived
I am staying right beside you

I tried to stay away
Just in case
Ive come to realize
We all have our place
Time time has a way you know
To make it clear
I have my role in this
I cant disappear
Or leave you here

Watching you drown
Ill follow you down
I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Are waving goodbye
I am staying right beside you



It keeps growing
And I can feel it breathe
I have been trying
To behave myself
It keeps growing
And I can feel it breathe
I have been trying
To tolerate you

Well I am reaching the point
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I thought maybe
I thought this would go away
But it continues
The only constant
Every day
Stronger

I will use my voice
And I will use my fist
To destroy
Everything I can

Now I know
What this is all about
Now I know
Exactly what I am

There is
a seed
Inside of me
That makes me
