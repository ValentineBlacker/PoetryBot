I have lived long enough having seen one thing that love hath an end†
Goddess and maiden and queen be near me now and befriend†
Thou art more than the day or the morrow the seasons that laugh or that weep†
For these give joy and sorrow but thou Proserpina sleep†
Sweet is the treading of wine and sweet the feet of the dove†
But a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love†
Yea is not even Apollo with hair and harpstring of gold†
A bitter God to follow a beautiful God to behold†
I am sick of singing the bays burn deep and chafe I am fain†
To rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain†
For the Gods we know not of who give us our daily breath†
We know they are cruel as love or life and lovely as death†
O Gods dethroned and deceased cast forth wiped out in a day†
From your wrath is the world released redeemed from your chains men say†
New Gods are crowned in the city their flowers have broken your rods†
They are merciful clothed with pity the young compassionate Gods†
But for me their new device is barren the days are bare†
Things long past over suffice and men forgotten that were†
Time and the Gods are at strife ye dwell in the midst thereof†
Draining a little life from the barren breasts of love†
I say to you cease take rest yea I say to you all be at peace†
Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease†
Wilt thou yet take all Galilean but these thou shalt not take†
The laurel the palms and the pÊan the breasts of the nymphs in the brake†
Breasts more soft than a doves that tremble with tenderer breath†
And all the wings of the Loves and all the joy before death†
All the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre†
Dropped and deep in the flowers with strings that flicker like fire†
More than these wilt thou give things fairer than all these things†
Nay for a little we live and life hath mutable wings†
A little while and we die shall life not thrive as it may†
For no man under the sky lives twice outliving his day†
And grief is a grievous thing and a man hath enough of his tears†
Why should he labour and bring fresh grief to blacken his years†
Thou hast conquered O pale Galilean the world has grown grey from thy breath†
We have drunken of things Lethean and fed on the fulness of death†
Laurel is green for a season and love is sweet for a day†
But love grows bitter with treason and laurel outlives not May†
Sleep shall we sleep after all for the world is not sweet in the end†
For the old faiths loosen and fall the new years ruin and rend†
Fate is a sea without shore and the soul is a rock that abides†
But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides†
O lips that the live blood faints in the leavings of racks and rods†
O ghastly glories of saints dead limbs of gibbeted Gods†
Though all men abase them before you in spirit and all knees bend†
I kneel not neither adore you but standing look to the end†
All delicate days and pleasant all spirits and sorrows are cast†
Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past†
Where beyond the extreme seawall and between the remote seagates†
Waste water washes and tall ships founder and deep death waits†
Where mighty with deepening sides clad about with the seas as with wings†
And impelled of invisible tides and fulfilled of unspeakable things†
Whiteeyed and poisonousfinned sharktoothed and serpentinecurled†
Rolls under the whitening wind of the future the wave of the world†
The depths stand naked in sunder behind it the storms flee away†
In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey†
In its sides is the northwind bound and its salt is of all mens tears†
With light of ruin and sound of changes and pulse of years†
With travail of day after day and with trouble of hour upon hour†
And bitter as blood is the spray and the crests are as fangs that devour†
And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be†
And its noise as the noise in a dream and its depth as the roots of the sea†
And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air†
And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble and time is made bare†
Will ye bridle the deep sea with reins will ye chasten the high sea with rods†
Will ye take her to chain her with chains who is older than all ye Gods†
All ye as a wind shall go by as a fire shall ye pass and be past†
Ye are Gods and behold ye shall die and the waves be upon you at last†
In the darkness of time in the deeps of the years in the changes of things†
Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps and the world shall forget you for kings†
Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod†
Though these that were Gods are dead and thou being dead art a God†
Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen and hidden her head†
Yet thy kingdom shall pass Galilean thy dead shall go down to thee dead†
Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around†
Thou art throned where another was king where another was queen she is crowned†
Yea once we had sight of another but now she is queen say these†
Not as thine not as thine was our mother a blossom of flowering seas†
Clothed round with the worlds desire as with raiment and fair as the foam†
And fleeter than kindled fire and a goddess and mother of Rome†
For thine came pale and a maiden and sister to sorrow but ours†
Her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers†
White rose of the rosewhite water a silver splendour a flame†
Bent down unto us that besought her and earth grew sweet with her name†
For thine came weeping a slave among slaves and rejected but she†
Came flushed from the fullflushed wave and imperial her foot on the sea†
And the wonderful waters knew her the winds and the viewless ways†
And the roses grew rosier and bluer the seablue stream of the bays†
Ye are fallen our lords by what token we wist that ye should not fall†
Ye were all so fair that are broken and one more fair than ye all†
But I turn to her still having seen she shall surely abide in the end†
Goddess and maiden and queen be near me now and befriend†
O daughter of earth of my mother her crown and blossom of birth†
I am also I also thy brother I go as I came unto earth†
In the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven the night where thou art†
Where the silence is more than all tunes where sleep overflows from the heart†
Where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world and the red rose is white†
And the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night†
And the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of Gods from afar†
Grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star†
In the sweet low light of thy face under heavens untrod by the sun†
Let my soul with their souls find place and forget what is done and undone†
Thou art more than the Gods who number the days of our temporal breath†
For these give labour and slumber but thou Proserpina death†
Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence I know†
I shall die as my fathers died and sleep as they sleep even so†
For the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span†
A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man*†
So long I endure no longer and laugh not again neither weep†
For there is no God found stronger than death and death is a sleep

Kneel down fair Love and fill thyself with tears
Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth
Upon the sides of mirth
Cover thy lips and eyelids let thine ears
Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing
Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs
Upon the flesh to cleave
Set pains therein and many a grievous thing
And many sorrows after each his wise
For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve
O Loves lute heard about the lands of death
Left hanged upon the trees that were therein
O Love and Time and Sin
Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath
Three lovers each one evil spoken of
O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine
Came softer with her praise
Abide a little for our ladys love
The kisses of her mouth were more than wine
And more than peace the passage of her days
O Love thou knowest if she were good to see
O Time thou shalt not find in any land
Till cast out of thine hand
The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee
Another woman fashioned like as this
O Sin thou knowest that all thy shame in her
Was made a goodly thing
Yea she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss
With her fair kiss and lips much lovelier
Than lips of amorous roses in late spring
By night there stood over against my bed
Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black
Both sides drawn fully back
From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red
And temples drained of purple and full of death
Her curled hair had the wave of seawater
And the seas gold in it
Her eyes were as a doves that sickeneth
Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her
And pearl and purple and amber on her feet
Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
Were painted all the secret ways of love
And covered things thereof
That hold delight as grapeflowers hold their wine
Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves
And brides that kept within the bridechamber
Their garment of soft shame
And weeping faces of the wearied loves
That swoon in sleep and awake wearier
With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame
The tears that through her eyelids fell on me
Made mine own bitter where they ran between
As blood had fallen therein
She saying Arise lift up thine eyes and see
If any glad thing be or any good
Now the best thing is taken forth of us
Even she to whom all praise
Was as one flower in a great multitude
One glorious flower of many and glorious
One day found gracious among many days
Even she whose handmaiden was Loveto whom
At kissing times across her stateliest bed
Kings bowed themselves and shed
Pale wine and honey with the honeycomb
And spikenard bruised for a burntoffering
Even she between whose lips the kiss became
As fire and frankincense
Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king
Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame
Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence
Then I beheld and lo on the other side
My ladys likeness crowned and robed and dead
Sweet still but now not red
Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died
And sweet but emptied of the bloods blue shade
The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes
And sweet but like spoilt gold
The weight of colour in her tresses weighed
And sweet but as a vesture with new dyes
The body that was clothed with love of old
Ah that my tears filled all her woven hair
And all the hollow bosom of her gown
Ah that my tears ran down
Even to the place where many kisses were
Even where her parted breastflowers have place
Even where they are cloven apartwho knows not this
Ah the flowers cleave apart
And their sweet fills the tender interspace
Ah the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss
Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart
Ah in the days when God did good to me
Each part about her was a righteous thing
Her mouth an almsgiving
The glory of her garments charity
The beauty of her bosom a good deed
In the good days when God kept sight of us
Love lay upon her eyes
And on that hair whereof the world takes heed
And all her body was more virtuous
Than souls of women fashioned otherwise
Now ballad gather poppies in thine hands
And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves
Rainrotten in rank lands
Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves
And grass that fades ere any of it be mown
And when thy bosom is filled full thereof
Seek out Deaths face ere the light altereth
And say "My master that was thrall to Love
Is become thrall to Death"
Bow down before him ballad sigh and groan
But make no sojourn in thy outgoing
For haply it may be
That when thy feet return at evening
Death shall come in with thee

  	I hid my heart in a nest of roses
Out of the suns way hidden apart
In a softer bed than the soft white snows is
Under the roses I hid my heart
Why would it sleep not why should it start
When never a leaf of the rosetree stirred
What made sleep flutter his wings and part
Only the song of a secret bird
Lie still I said for the winds wing closes
And mild leaves muffle the keen suns dart
Lie still for the wind on the warm seas dozes
And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art
Does a thought in thee still as a thorns wound smart
Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred
What bids the lips of thy sleep dispart
Only the song of a secret bird

The green lands name that a charm encloses
It never was writ in the travellers chart
And sweet on its trees as the fruit that grows is
It never was sold in the merchants mart
The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart
And sleeps are the tunes in its treetops heard
No hounds note wakens the wildwood hart
Only the song of a secret bird
ENVOI
In the world of dreams I have chosen my part
To sleep for a season and hear no word
Of true loves truth or of light loves art
Only the song of a secret bird 

	A Ballad of Burdens
The burden of fair women Vain delight
And love selfslain in some sweet shameful way
And sorrowful old age that comes by night
As a thief comes that has no heart by day
And change that finds fair cheeks and leaves them grey
And weariness that keeps awake for hire
And grief that says what pleasure used to say
This is the end of every mans desire
The burden of bought kisses This is sore
A burden without fruit in childbearing
Between the nightfall and the dawn threescore
Threescore between the dawn and evening
The shuddering in thy lips the shuddering
In thy sad eyelids tremulous like fire
Makes love seem shameful and a wretched thing
This is the end of every mans desire
The burden of sweet speeches Nay kneel down
Cover thy head and weep for verily
These marketmen that buy thy white and brown
In the last days shall take no thought for thee
In the last days like earth thy face shall be
Yea like seamarsh made thick with brine and mire
Sad with sick leavings of the sterile sea
This is the end of every mans desire
The burden of long living Thou shalt fear
Waking and sleeping mourn upon thy bed
And say at night "Would God the day were here"
And say at dawn "Would God the day were dead"
With weary days thou shalt be clothed and fed
And wear remorse of heart for thine attire
Pain for thy girdle and sorrow upon thine head
This is the end of every mans desire
The burden of bright colours Thou shalt see
Gold tarnished and the grey above the green
And as the thing thou seest thy face shall be
And no more as the thing beforetime seen
And thou shalt say of mercy "It hath been"
And living watch the old lips and loves expire
And talking tears shall take thy breath between
This is the end of every mans desire
The burden of sad sayings In that day
Thou shalt tell all thy days and hours and tell
Thy times and ways and words of love and say
How one was dear and one desirable
And sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell
But now with lights reverse the old hours retire
And the last hour is shod with fire from hell
This is the end of every mans desire
The burden of four seasons Rain in spring
White rain and wind among the tender trees
A summer of green sorrows gathering
Rank autumn in a mist of miseries
With sad face set towards the year that sees
The charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre
And winter wan with many maladies
This is the end of every mans desire
The burden of dead faces Out of sight
And out of love beyond the reach of hands
Changed in the changing of the dark and light
They walk and weep about the barren lands
Where no seed is nor any garner stands
Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire
And times turned glass lets through the sighing sands
This is the end of every mans desire
The burden of much gladness Life and lust
Forsake thee and the face of thy delight
And underfoot the heavy hour strews dust
And overhead strange weathers burn and bite
And where the red was lo the bloodless white
And where the truth was the likeness of a liar
And where the day was the likeness of the night
This is the end of every mans desire
LENVOY
Princes and ye whom pleasure quickeneth
Heed well this rhyme before your pleasure tire
For life is sweet but after life is death
This is the end of every mans desire 

	IN the greenest growth of the Maytime
I rode where the woods were wet
Between the dawn and the daytime
The spring was glad that we met
There was something the season wanted
Though the ways and the woods smelt sweet
The breath at your lips that panted
The pulse of the grass at your feet
You came and the sun came after
And the green grew golden above
And the flagflowers lightened with laughter
And the meadowsweet shook with love
Your feet in the fullgrown grasses
Moved soft as a weak wind blows
You passed me as April passes
With face made out of a rose
By the stream where the stems were slender
Your bright foot paused at the sedge
It might be to watch the tender
Light leaves in the springtime hedge
On boughs that the sweet month blanches
With flowery frost of May
It might be a bird in the branches
It might be a thorn in the way
I waited to watch you linger
With foot drawn back from the dew
Till a sunbeam straight like a finger
Struck sharp through the leaves at you
And a bird overhead sang Follow
And a bird to the right sang Here
And the arch of the leaves was hollow
And the meaning of May was clear
I saw where the sunís hand pointed
I knew what the birdís note said
By the dawn and the dewfall anointed
You were queen by the gold on your head
As the glimpse of a burntout ember
Recalls a regret of the sun
I remember forget and remember
What Love saw done and undone
I remember the way we parted
The day and the way we met
You hoped we were both brokenhearted
And knew we should both forget
And May with her world in flower
Seemed still to murmur and smile
As you murmured and smiled for an hour
I saw you turn at the stile
A hand like a white woodblossom
You lifted and waved and passed
With head hung down to the bosom
And pale as it seemed at last
And the best and the worst of this is
That neither is most to blame
If youíve forgotten my kisses
And Iíve forgotten your name 


LIFT UP thy lips turn round look back for love
Blind love that comes by night and casts out rest
Of all things tired thy lips look weariest
Save the long smile that they are wearied of
Ah sweet albeit no love be sweet enough
Choose of two loves and cleave unto the best
Two loves at either blossom of thy breast
Strive until one be under and one above
Their breath is fire upon the amorous air
Fire in thine eyes and where thy lips suspire
And whosoever hath seen thee being so fair
Two things turn all his life and blood to fire
A strong desire begot on great despair
A great despair cast out by strong desire

Where between sleep and life some brief space is
With love like gold bound round about the head
Sex to sweet sex with lips and limbs is wed
Turning the fruitful feud of hers and his
To the waste wedlock of a sterile kiss
Yet from them something like as fire is shed
That shall not be assuaged till death be dead
Though neither life nor sleep can find out this
Love made himself of flesh that perisheth
A pleasurehouse for all the loves his kin
But on the one side sat a man like death
And on the other a woman sat like sin
So with veiled eyes and sobs between his breath
Love turned himself and would not enter in

Love is it love or sleep or shadow or light
That lies between thine eyelids and thine eyes
Like a flower laid upon a flower it lies
Or like the nightís dew laid upon the night
Love stands upon thy left hand and thy right
Yet by no sunset and by no moonrise
Shall make thee man and ease a womanís sighs
Or make thee woman for a manís delight
To what strange end hath some strange god made fair
The double blossom of two fruitless flowers
Hid love in all the folds of all thy hair
Fed thee on summers watered thee with showers
Given all the gold that all the seasons wear
To thee that art a thing of barren hours

Yea love I see it is not love but fear
Nay sweet it is not fear but love I know
Or wherefore should thy bodyís blossom blow
So sweetly or thine eyelids leave so clear
Thy gracious eyes that never made a tearó
Though for their love our tears like blood should flow
Though love and life and death should come and go
So dreadful so desirable so dear
Yea sweet I know I saw in what swift wise
Beneath the womanís and the waterís kiss
Thy moist limbs melted into Salmacis
And the large light turned tender in thine eyes
And all thy boyís breath softened into sighs
But Love being blind how should he know of this
 
  	Swallow my sister O sister swallow
How can thine heart be full of the spring
A thousand summers are over and dead
What hast thou found in the spring to follow
What hast thou found in thine heart to sing
What wilt thou do when the summer is shed
O swallow sister O fair swift swallow
Why wilt thou fly after spring to the south
The soft south whither thine heart is set
Shall not the grief of the old time follow
Shall not the song thereof cleave to thy mouth
Hast thou forgotten ere I forget
Sister my sister O fleet sweet swallow
Thy way is long to the sun and the south
But I fulfilled of my hearts desire
Shedding my song upon height upon hollow
From tawny body and sweet small mouth
Feed the heart of the night with fire
I the nightingale all spring through
O swallow sister O changing swallow
All spring through till the spring be done
Clothed with the light of the night on the dew
Sing while the hours and the wild birds follow
Take flight and follow and find the sun
Sister my sister O soft light swallow
Though all things feast in the springs guestchamber
How hast thou heart to be glad thereof yet
For where thou fliest I shall not follow
Till life forget and death remember
Till thou remember and I forget
Swallow my sister O singing swallow
I know not how thou hast heart to sing
Hast thou the heart is it all past over
Thy lord the summer is good to follow
And fair the feet of thy lover the spring
But what wilt thou say to the spring thy lover
O swallow sister O fleeting swallow
My heart in me is a molten ember
And over my head the waves have met
But thou wouldst tarry or I would follow
Could I forget or thou remember
Couldst thou remember and I forget
O sweet stray sister O shifting swallow
The hearts division divideth us
Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree
But mine goes forth among seagulfs hollow
To the place of the slaying of Itylus
The feast of Daulis the Thracian sea
O swallow sister O rapid swallow
I pray thee sing not a little space
Are not the roofs and the lintels wet
The woven web that was plain to follow
The small slain body the flowerlike face
Can I remember if thou forget
O sister sister thy firstbegotten
The hands that cling and the feet that follow
The voice of the childs blood crying yet
Who hath remembered me who hath forgotten
Thou hast forgotten O summer swallow
But the world shall end when I forget 

  	IF YOU loved me ever so little
I could bear the bonds that gall
I could dream the bonds were brittle
You do not love me at all
O beautiful lips O bosom
More white than the moonís and warm
A sterile a ruinous blossom
Is blown your way in a storm
As the lost white feverish limbs
Of the Lesbian Sappho adrift
In foam where the seaweed swims
Swam loose for the streams to lift
My heart swims blind in a sea
That stuns me swims to and fro
And gathers to windward and lee
Lamentation and mourning and woe
A broken an emptied boat
Sea saps it winds blow apart
Sick and adrift and afloat
The barren waif of a heart
Where when the gods would be cruel
Do they go for a torture where
Plant thorns set pain like a jewel
Ah not in the flesh not there
The racks of earth and the rods
Are weak as foam on the sands
In the heart is the prey for gods
Who crucify hearts not hands
Mere pangs corrode and consume
Dead when life dies in the brain
In the infinite spirit is room
For the pulse of an infinite pain
I wish you were dead my dear
I would give you had I to give
Some death too bitter to fear
It is better to die than live
I wish you were stricken of thunder
And burnt with a bright flame through
Consumed and cloven in sunder
I dead at your feet like you
If I could but know after all
I might cease to hunger and ache
Though your heart were ever so small
If it were not a stone or a snake
You are crueller you that we love
Than hatred hunger or death
You have eyes and breasts like a dove
And you kill menís hearts with a breath
As plague in a poisonous city
Insults and exults on her dead
So you when pallid for pity
Comes love and fawns to be fed
As a tame beast writhes and wheedles
He fawns to be fed with wiles
You carve him a cross of needles
And whet them sharp as your smiles
He is patient of thorn and whip
He is dumb under axe or dart
You suck with a sleepy red lip
The wet red wounds in his heart
You thrill as his pulses dwindle
You brighten and warm as he bleeds
With insatiable eyes that kindle
And insatiable mouth that feeds
Your hands nailed love to the tree
You stript him scourged him with rods
And drowned him deep in the sea
That hides the dead and their gods
And for all this die will he not
There is no man sees him but I
You came and went and forgot
I hope he will some day die 

Am I not he that hath made thee and begotten thee
I God the spirit of man
Wherefore now these eighteen years hast thou forgotten me
From whom thy life began
Thy lifeblood and thy lifebreath and thy beauty
Thy might of hands and feet
Thy soul made strong for divinity of duty
And service which was sweet
Through the red sea brimmed with blood didst thou not follow me
As one that walks in trance
Was the storm strong to break or the sea to swallow thee
When thou wast free and France
I am Freedom God and man O France that plead with thee
How long now shall I plead
Was I not with thee in travail and in need with thee
Thy sore travail and need
Thou wast fairest and first of my virginvested daughters
Fairest and foremost thou
And thy breast was white though thy hands were red with slaughters
Thy breast a harlots now
O foolish virgin and fair among the fallen
A ruin where satyrs dance
A garden wasted for beasts to crawl and brawl in
What hast thou done with France
Where is she who bared her bosom but to thunder
Her brow to storm and flame
And before her face was the red sea cloven in sunder
And all its waves made tame
And the surf wherein the broadbased rocks were shaking
She saw far off divide
At the blast of the breath of the battle blown and breaking
And weight of wind and tide
And the ravin and the ruin of throned nations
And every royal race
And the kingdoms and kings from the state of their high stations
That fell before her face
Yea great was the fall of them all that rose against her
From the earths oldhistoried heights
For my hands were fire and my wings as walls that fenced her
Mine eyes as pilotlights
Not as guerdons given of kings the gifts I brought her
Not strengths that pass away
But my heart my breath of life O France O daughter
I gave thee in that day
Yea the hearts blood of a very God I gave thee
Breathed in thy mouth his breath
Was my word as a mans having no more strength to save thee
From this worse thing than death
Didst thou dream of it only the day that I stood nigh thee
Was all its light a dream
When that iron surf roared backwards and went by thee
Unscathed of storm or stream
When thy sons rose up and thy young men stood together
One equal face of fight
And my flag swam high as the swimming seafoams feather
Laughing a lamp of light
Ah the lordly laughter and light of it that lightened
Heavenhigh the heavens whole length
Ah the hearts of heroes pierced the bright lips whitened
Of strong men in their strength
Ah the bannerpoles the stretch of straightening streamers
Straining their full reach out
Ah the mens hands making true the dreams of dreamers
The hopes brought forth in doubt
Ah the noise of horse the charge and thunder of drumming
And swaying and sweep of swords
Ah the light that led them through of the worlds life coming
Clear of its lies and lords
By the lightning of the lips of guns whose flashes
Made plain the strayed worlds way
By the flame that left her dead old sins in ashes
Swept out of sight of day
By thy children whose bare feet were shod with thunder
Their bare hands mailed with fire
By the faith that went with them waking fear and wonder
Hearts love and high desire
By the tumult of the waves of nations waking
Blind in the loud wide night
By the wind that went on the worlds waste waters making
Their marble darkness white
As the flash of the flakes of the foam flared lamplike leaping
From wave to gladdening wave
Making wide the fastshut eyes of thraldom sleeping
The sleep of the unclean grave
By the fire of equality terrible devouring
Divine that brought forth good
By the lands it purged and wasted and left flowering
With bloom of brotherhood
By the lips of fraternity that for loves sake uttered
Fierce words and fires of death
But the eyes were deep as loves and the fierce lips fluttered
With loves own living breath
By thy weaponed hands brows helmed and bare feet spurning
The bared head of a king
By the storm of sunrise round thee risen and burning
Why hast thou done this thing
Thou hast mixed thy limbs with the son of a harlot a stranger
Mouth to mouth limb to limb
Thou bride of a God because of the bridesman Danger
To bring forth seed to him
For thou thoughtest inly the terrible bridegroom wakes me
When I would sleep to go
The fire of his mouth consumes and the red kiss shakes me
More bitter than a blow
Rise up my beloved go forth to meet the stranger
Put forth thine arm he saith
Fear thou not at all though the bridesman should be Danger
The bridesmaid should be Death
I the bridegroom am I not with thee O bridal nation
O wedded France to strive
To destroy the sins of the earth with divine devastation
Till none be left alive
Lo her growths of sons foliage of men and frondage
Broad boughs of the oldworld tree
With iron of shame and with pruninghooks of bondage
They are shorn from sea to sea
Lo I set wings to thy feet that have been wingless
Till the utter race be run
Till the priestless temples cry to the thrones made kingless
Are we not also undone
Till the immeasurable Republic arise and lighten
Above these quick and dead
And her awful robes be changed and her red robes whiten
Her warringrobes of red
But thou wouldst not saying I am weary and faint to follow
Let me lie down and rest
And hast sought out shame to sleep with mire to wallow
Yea a much fouler breast
And thine own hast made prostitute sold and shamed and bared it
Thy bosom which was mine
And the bread of the word I gave thee hast soiled and shared it
Among these snakes and swine
As a harlot thou wast handled and polluted
Thy faith held light as foam
That thou sentest men thy sons thy sons imbruted
To slay thine elder Rome
Therefore O harlot I gave thee to the accurst one
By night to be defiled
To thy second shame and a fouler than the first one
That got thee first with child
Yet I know thee turning back now to behold me
To bow thee and make thee bare
Not for sins sake but penitence by my feet to hold me
And wipe them with thine hair
And sweet ointment of thy grief thou hast brought thy master
And set before thy lord
From a box of flawed and broken alabaster
Thy broken spirit poured
And loveofferings tears and perfumes hast thou given me
To reach my feet and touch
Therefore thy sins which are many are forgiven thee
Because thou hast loved much 

  	STATELY kindly lordly friend
Condescend
Here to sit by me and turn
Glorious eyes that smile and burn
Golden eyes loves lustrous meed
On the golden page I read
All your wondrous wealth of hair
Dark and fair
Silkenshaggy soft and bright
As the clouds and beams of night
Pays my reverent hands caress
Back with friendlier gentleness
Dogs may fawn on all and some
As they come
You a friend of loftier mind
Answer friends alone in kind
Just your foot upon my hand
Softly bids it understand

Morning round this silent sweet
Gardenseat
Sheds its wealth of gathering light
Thrills the gradual clouds with might
Changes woodland orchard heath
Lawn and garden there beneath
Fair and dim they gleamed below
Now they glow
Deep as even your sunbright eyes
Fair as even the wakening skies
Can it not or can it be
Now that you give thanks to see 
May not you rejoice as I
Seeing the sky
Change to heaven revealed and bid
Earth reveal the heaven it hid
All night long from stars and moon
Now the sun sets all in tune
What within you wakes with day
Who can say
All too little may we tell
Friends who like each other well
What might haply if we might
Bid us read our lives aright
Wild on woodland ways your sires
Flashed like fires
Fair as flame and fierce and fleet
As with wings on wingless feet
Shone and sprang your mother free
Bright and brave as wind or sea
Free and proud and glad as they
Here today
Rests or roams their radiant child
Vanquished not but reconciled
Free from curb of aught above
Save the lovely curb of love
Love through dreams of souls divine
Fain would shine
Round a dawn whose light and song
Then should right our mutual wrong
Speak and seal the lovelit law
Sweet Assisis seer foresaw
Dreams were theirs yet haply may
Dawn a day
When such friends and fellows born
Seeing our earth as fair at morn
May for wiser loves sake see
More of heavens deep heart than we 

I found in dreams a place of wind and flowers
    Full of sweet trees and colour of glad grass
    In midst whereof there was
  A lady clothed like summer with sweet hours
  Her beauty fervent as a fiery moon
    Made my blood burn and swoon
      Like a flame rained upon
  Sorrow had filled her shaken eyelids blue
  And her mouths sad red heavy rose all through
      Seemed sad with glad things gone

  She held a little cithern by the strings
    Shaped heartwise strung with subtlecoloured hair
    Of some dead luteplayer
  That in dead years had done delicious things
  The seven strings were named accordingly
    The first string charity
      The second tenderness
  The rest were pleasure sorrow sleep and sin
  And lovingkindness that is pitys kin
      And is most pitiless

  There were three men with her each garmented
    With gold and shod with gold upon the feet
    And with plucked ears of wheat
  The first mans hair was wound upon his head
  His face was red and his mouth curled and sad
    All his gold garment had
      Pale stains of dust and rust
  A riven hood was pulled across his eyes
  The token of him being upon this wise
      Made for a sign of Lust

  The next was Shame with hollow heavy face
    Coloured like green wood when flame kindles it
    He hath such feeble feet
  They may not well endure in any place
  His face was full of grey old miseries
    And all his bloods increase
      Was even increase of pain
  The last was Fear that is akin to Death
  He is Shames friend and always as Shame saith
      Fear answers him again

  My soul said in me This is marvellous
    Seeing the airs face is not so delicate
    Nor the suns grace so great
  If sin and she be kin or amorous
  And seeing where maidens served her on their knees
    I bade one crave of these
      To know the cause thereof
  Then Fear said I am Pity that was dead
  And Shame said I am Sorrow comforted
      And Lust said I am Love

  Thereat her hands began a luteplaying
    And her sweet mouth a song in a strange tongue
    And all the while she sung
  There was no sound but long tears following
  Long tears upon mens faces waxen white
    With extreme sad delight
      But those three following men
  Became as men raised up among the dead
  Great glad mouths open and fair cheeks made red
      With childs blood come again

  Then I said Now assuredly I see
    My lady is perfect and transfigureth
    All sin and sorrow and death
  Making them fair as her own eyelids be
  Or lips wherein my whole souls life abides
    Or as her sweet white sides
      And bosom carved to kiss
  Now therefore if her pity further me
  Doubtless for her sake all my days shall be
      As righteous as she is

  Forth ballad and take roses in both arms
    Even till the top rose touch thee in the throat
  Where the least thornprick harms
    And girdled in thy golden singingcoat
  Come thou before my lady and say this
    Borgia thy gold hairs colour burns in me
      Thy mouth makes beat my blood in feverish rhymes
    Therefore so many as these roses be
      Kiss me so many times
  Then it may be seeing how sweet she is
    That she will stoop herself none otherwise
      Than a blown vinebranch doth
    And kiss thee with soft laughter on thine eyes
      Ballad and on thy mouth

  Kneel down fair Love and fill thyself with tears
  Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth
  Upon the sides of mirth
  Cover thy lips and eyelids let thine ears
  Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing
  Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs
  Upon the flesh to cleave
  Set pains therein and many a grievous thing
  And many sorrows after each his wise
  For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve

  O Loves lute heard about the lands of death
  Left hanged upon the trees that were therein
  O Love and Time and Sin
  Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath
  Three lovers each one evil spoken of
  O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine
  Came softer with her praise
  Abide a little for our ladys love
  The kisses of her mouth were more than wine
  And more than peace the passage of her days

  O Love thou knowest if she were good to see
  O Time thou shalt not find in any land
  Till cast out of thine hand
  The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee
  Another woman fashioned like as this
  O Sin thou knowest that all thy shame in her
  Was made a goodly thing
  Yea she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss
  With her fair kiss and lips much lovelier
  Than lips of amorous roses in late spring

  By night there stood over against my bed
  Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black
  Both sides drawn fully back
  From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red
  And temples drained of purple and full of death
  Her curled hair had the wave of seawater
  And the seas gold in it
  Her eyes were as a doves that sickeneth
  Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her
  And pearl and purple and amber on her feet

  Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
  Were painted all the secret ways of love
  And covered things thereof
  That hold delight as grapeflowers hold their wine
  Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves
  And brides that kept within the bridechamber
  Their garment of soft shame
  And weeping faces of the wearied loves
  That swoon in sleep and awake wearier
  With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame

  The tears that through her eyelids fell on me
  Made mine own bitter where they ran between
  As blood had fallen therein
  She saying Arise lift up thine eyes and see
  If any glad thing be or any good
  Now the best thing is taken forth of us
  Even she to whom all praise
  Was as one flower in a great multitude
  One glorious flower of many and glorious
  One day found gracious among many days

  Even she whose handmaiden was Loveto whom
  At kissing times across her stateliest bed
  Kings bowed themselves and shed
  Pale wine and honey with the honeycomb
  And spikenard bruised for a burntoffering
  Even she between whose lips the kiss became
  As fire and frankincense
  Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king
  Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame
  Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence

  Then I beheld and lo on the other side
  My ladys likeness crowned and robed and dead
  Sweet still but now not red
  Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died
  And sweet but emptied of the bloods blue shade
  The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes
  And sweet but like spoilt gold
  The weight of colour in her tresses weighed
  And sweet but as a vesture with new dyes
  The body that was clothed with love of old

  Ah that my tears filled all her woven hair
  And all the hollow bosom of her gown
  Ah that my tears ran down
  Even to the place where many kisses were
  Even where her parted breastflowers have place
  Even where they are cloven apartwho knows not this
  Ah the flowers cleave apart
  And their sweet fills the tender interspace
  Ah the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss
  Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart

  Ah in the days when God did good to me
  Each part about her was a righteous thing
  Her mouth an almsgiving
  The glory of her garments charity
  The beauty of her bosom a good deed
  In the good days when God kept sight of us
  Love lay upon her eyes
  And on that hair whereof the world takes heed
  And all her body was more virtuous
  Than souls of women fashioned otherwise

  Now ballad gather poppies in thine hands
  And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves
  Rainrotten in rank lands
  Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves
  And grass that fades ere any of it be mown
  And when thy bosom is filled full thereof
  Seek out Deaths face ere the light altereth
  And say "My master that was thrall to Love
  Is become thrall to Death"
  Bow down before him ballad sigh and groan
  But make no sojourn in thy outgoing
  For haply it may be
  That when thy feet return at evening
  Death shall come in with thee



  Asleep or waking is it for her neck
  Kissed over close wears yet a purple speck
    Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out
  Soft and stung softlyfairer for a fleck

  But though my lips shut sucking on the place
  There is no vein at work upon her face
    Her eyelids are so peaceable no doubt
  Deep sleep has warmed her blood through all its ways

  Lo this is she that was the worlds delight
  The old grey years were parcels of her might
    The strewings of the ways wherein she trod
  Were the twain seasons of the day and night

  Lo she was thus when her clear limbs enticed
  All lips that now grow sad with kissing Christ
    Stained with blood fallen from the feet of God
  The feet and hands whereat our souls were priced

  Alas Lord surely thou art great and fair
  But lo her wonderfully woven hair
    And thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss
  But see now Lord her mouth is lovelier

  She is right fair what hath she done to thee
  Nay fair Lord Christ lift up thine eyes and see
    Had now thy mother such a liplike this
  Thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me

  Inside the Horsel here the air is hot
  Right little peace one hath for it God wot
    The scented dusty daylight burns the air
  And my heart chokes me till I hear it not

  Behold my Venus my souls body lies
  With my love laid upon her garmentwise
    Feeling my love in all her limbs and hair
  And shed between her eyelids through her eyes

  She holds my heart in her sweet open hands
  Hanging asleep hard by her head there stands
    Crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire
  Love wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands

  Hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume
  That shift and steamloose clots of arid fume
    From the seas panting mouth of dry desire
  There stands he like one labouring at a loom

  The warp holds fast across and every thread
  That makes the woof up has dry specks of red
    Always the shuttle cleaves clean through and he
  Weaves with the hair of many a ruined head

  Love is not glad nor sorry as I deem
  Labouring he dreams and labours in the dream
    Till when the spool is finished lo I see
  His web reeled off curls and goes out like steam

  Night falls like fire the heavy lights run low
  And as they drop my blood and body so
    Shake as the flame shakes full of days and hours
  That sleep not neither weep they as they go

  Ah yet would God this flesh of mine might be
  Where air might wash and long leaves cover me
    Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers
  Or where the winds feet shine along the sea

  Ah yet would God that stems and roots were bred
  Out of my weary body and my head
    That sleep were sealed upon me with a seal
  And I were as the least of all his dead

  Would God my blood were dew to feed the grass
  Mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass
    My body broken as a turning wheel
  And my mouth stricken ere it saith Alas

  Ah God that love were as a flower or flame
  That life were as the naming of a name
    That death were not more pitiful than desire
  That these things were not one thing and the same

  Behold now surely somewhere there is death
  For each man hath some space of years he saith
    A little space of time ere time expire
  A little day a little way of breath

  And lo between the sundawn and the sun
  His days work and his nights work are undone
    And lo between the nightfall and the light
  He is not and none knoweth of such an one

  Ah God that I were as all souls that be
  As any herb or leaf of any tree
    As men that toil through hours of labouring night
  As bones of men under the deep sharp sea

  Outside it must be winter among men
  For at the gold bars of the gates again
    I heard all night and all the hours of it
  The winds wet wings and fingers drip with rain

  Knights gather riding sharp for cold I know
  The ways and woods are strangled with the snow
    And with short song the maidens spin and sit
  Until Christs birthnight lilylike arow

  The scent and shadow shed about me make
  The very soul in all my senses ache
    The hot hard night is fed upon my breath
  And sleep beholds me from afar awake

  Alas but surely where the hills grow deep
  Or where the wild ways of the sea are steep
    Or in strange places somewhere there is death
  And on deaths face the scattered hair of sleep

  There loverlike with lips and limbs that meet
  They lie they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat
    But me the hot and hungry days devour
  And in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet

  No fruit of theirs but fruit of my desire
  For her loves sake whose lips through mine respire
    Her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower
  Mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire

  So lie we not as sleep that lies by death
  With heavy kisses and with happy breath
    Not as man lies by woman when the bride
  Laughs low for loves sake and the words he saith

  For she lies laughing low with love she lies
  And turns his kisses on her lips to sighs
    To sighing sound of lips unsatisfied
  And the sweet tears are tender with her eyes

  Ah not as they but as the souls that were
  Slain in the old time having found her fair
    Who sleeping with her lips upon their eyes
  Heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair

  Their blood runs round the roots of time like rain
  She casts them forth and gathers them again
    With nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies
  Exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain

  Her little chambers drip with flowerlike red
  Her girdles and the chaplets of her head
    Her armlets and her anklets with her feet
  She tramples all that winepress of the dead

  Her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires
  With loves burnt out and unassuaged desires
    Between her lips the steam of them is sweet
  The languor in her ears of many lyres

  Her beds are full of perfume and sad sound
  Her doors are made with music and barred round
    With sighing and with laughter and with tears
  With tears whereby strong souls of men are bound

  There is the knight Adonis that was slain
  With flesh and blood she chains him for a chain
    The body and the spirit in her ears
  Cry for her lips divide him vein by vein

  Yea all she slayeth yea every man save me
  Me love thy lover that must cleave to thee
    Till the ending of the days and ways of earth
  The shaking of the sources of the sea

  Me most forsaken of all souls that fell
  Me satiated with things insatiable
    Me for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth
  Yea laughter kindles at the heart of hell

  Alas thy beauty for thy mouths sweet sake
  My soul is bitter to me my limbs quake
    As water as the flesh of men that weep
  As their hearts vein whose heart goes nigh to break

  Ah God that sleep with flowersweet fingertips
  Would crush the fruit of death upon my lips
    Ah God that death would tread the grapes of sleep
  And wring their juice upon me as it drips

  There is no change of cheer for many days
  But change of chimes high up in the air that sways
    Rung by the running fingers of the wind
  And singing sorrows heard on hidden ways

  Day smiteth day in twain night sundereth night
  And on mine eyes the dark sits as the light
    Yea Lord thou knowest I know not having sinned
  If heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight

  Yea as if earth were sprinkled over me
  Such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea
    Each pore doth yearn and the dried blood thereof
  Gasps by sick fits my heart swims heavily

  There is a feverish famine in my veins
  Below her bosom where a crushed grape stains
    The white and blue there my lips caught and clove
  An hour since and what mark of me remains

  I dare not always touch her lest the kiss
  Leave my lips charred Yea Lord a little bliss
    Brief bitter bliss one hath for a great sin
  Nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is

  Sin is it sin whereby mens souls are thrust
  Into the pit yet had I a good trust
    To save my soul before it slipped therein
  Trod under by the fireshod feet of lust

  For if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath
  I look between the iron sides of death
    Into sad hell where all sweet love hath end
  All but the pain that never finisheth

  There are the naked faces of great kings
  The singing folk with all their luteplayings
    There when one cometh he shall have to friend
  The grave that covets and the worm that clings

  There sit the knights that were so great of hand
  The ladies that were queens of fair green land
    Grown grey and black now brought unto the dust
  Soiled without raiment clad about with sand

  There is one end for all of them they sit
  Naked and sad they drink the dregs of it
    Trodden as grapes in the winepress of lust
  Trampled and trodden by the fiery feet

  I see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell
  Cities and people whom the gods loved well
    Yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold
  And for their sakes on her the fire of hell

  And softer than the Egyptian loteleaf is
  The queen whose face was worth the world to kiss
    Wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold
  And large pale lips of strong Semiramis

  Curled like a tigers that curl back to feed
  Red only where the last kiss made them bleed
    Her hair most thick with many a carven gem
  Deep in the mane greatchested like a steed

  Yea with red sin the faces of them shine
  But in all these there was no sin like mine
    No not in all the strange great sins of them
  That made the winepress froth and foam with wine

  For I was of Christs choosing I Gods knight
  No blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light
    I can well see for all the dusty days
  Gone past the clean great time of goodly fight

  I smell the breathing battle sharp with blows
  With shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows
    The fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways
  Sounds and long lights are shed between the rows

  Of beautiful mailed men the edged light slips
  Most like a snake that takes short breath and dips
    Sharp from the beautifully bending head
  With all its gracious body lithe as lips

  That curl in touching you right in this wise
  My sword doth seeming fire in mine own eyes
    Leaving all colours in them brown and red
  And flecked with death then the keen breaths like sighs

  The caughtup choked dry laughters following them
  When all the fighting face is grown a flame
    For pleasure and the pulse that stuns the ears
  And the hearts gladness of the goodly game

  Let me think yet a little I do know
  These things were sweet but sweet such years ago
    Their savour is all turned now into tears
  Yea ten years since where the blue ripples blow

Some woman fell aweeping whom this thief
  Would beat when he had drunken yet small grief
    Hath any for the ridding of such knaves
  Yea if one wept I doubt her teen was brief

  This bitter love is sorrow in all lands
  Draining of eyelids wringing of drenched hands
    Sighing of hearts and filling up of graves
  A sign across the head of the world he stands

  An one that hath a plaguemark on his brows
  Dust and spilt blood do track him to his house
    Down under earth sweet smells of lip and cheek
  Like a sweet snakes breath made more poisonous

  With chewing of some perfumed deadly grass
  Are shed all round his passage if he pass
    And their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak
  Sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was

  As one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds
  Smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds
    And tracking ever slotwise the warm smell
  Is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds

  His head far down the hot sweet throat of her
  So one tracks love whose breath is deadlier
    And lo one springe and you are fast in hell
  Fast as the gins grip of a wayfarer

  I think now as the heavy hours decease
  One after one and bitter thoughts increase
    One upon one of all sweet finished things
  The breaking of the battle the long peace

  Wherein we sat clothed softly each mans hair
  Crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair
    The sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings
  And noise of singing in the late sweet air

  I sang of love too knowing nought thereof
  "Sweeter" I said "the little laugh of love
    Than tears out of the eyes of Magdalen
  Or any fallen feather of the Dove

  "The broken little laugh that spoils a kiss
  The ache of purple pulses and the bliss
    Of blinded eyelids that expand again
  Love draws them open with those lips of his

  "Lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown
  Of one same fire and colour with their own
    Then ere one sleep appeased with sacrifice
  Where his lips wounded there his lips atone"

  I sang these things long since and knew them not
  "Lo here is love or there is love God wot
    This man and that finds favour in his eyes"
  I said "but I what guerdon have I got

  "The dust of praise that is blown everywhere
  In all mens faces with the common air
    The bayleaf that wants chafing to be sweet
  Before they wind it in a singers hair"

  So that one dawn I rode forth sorrowing
  I had no hope but of some evil thing
    And so rode slowly past the windy wheat
  And past the vineyard and the waterspring

  Up to the Horsel A great eldertree
  Held back its heaps of flowers to let me see
    The ripe tall grass and one that walked therein
  Naked with hair shed over to the knee

  She walked between the blossom and the grass
  I knew the beauty of her what she was
    The beauty of her body and her sin
  And in my flesh the sin of hers alas

  Alas for sorrow is all the end of this
  O sad kissed mouth how sorrowful it is
    O breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings
  Red with the bitter blossom of a kiss

  Ah with blind lips I felt for you and found
  About my neck your hands and hair enwound
    The hands that stifle and the hair that stings
  I felt them fasten sharply without sound

  Yea for my sin I had great store of bliss
  Rise up make answer for me let thy kiss
    Seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin
  Lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is

  Yet I waxed faint with fume of barren bowers
  And murmuring of the heavyheaded hours
    And let the doves beak fret and peck within
  My lips in vain and Love shed fruitless flowers

  So that God looked upon me when your hands
  Were hot about me yea God brake my bands
    To save my soul alive and I came forth
  Like a man blind and naked in strange lands

  That hears men laugh and weep and knows not whence
  Nor wherefore but is broken in his sense
    Howbeit I met folk riding from the north
  Towards Rome to purge them of their souls offence

  And rode with them and spake to none the day
  Stunned me like lights upon some wizard way
    And ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight
  So rode I hearing all these chant and pray

  And marvelled till before us rose and fell
  White cursed hills like outer skirts of hell
    Seen where mens eyes look through the day to night
  Like a jagged shells lips harsh untunable

  Blown in between by devils wrangling breath
  Nathless we won well past that hell and death
    Down to the sweet land where all airs are good
  Even unto Rome where Gods grace tarrieth

  Then came each man and worshipped at his knees
  Who in the Lord Gods likeness bears the keys
    To bind or loose and called on Christs shed blood
  And so the sweetsouled father gave him ease

  But when I came I fell down at his feet
  Saying "Father though the Lords blood be right sweet
    The spot it takes not off the panthers skin
  Nor shall an Ethiops stain be bleached with it

  "Lo I have sinned and have spat out at God
  Wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod
    More sharp because of mine exceeding sin
  And all his raiment redder than bright blood

  "Before mine eyes yea for my sake I wot
  The heat of hell is waxen seven times hot
    Through my great sin" Then spake he some sweet word
  Giving me cheer which thing availed me not

  Yea scarce I wist if such indeed were said
  For when I ceasedlo as one newly dead
    Who hears a great cry out of hell I heard
  The crying of his voice across my head

  "Until this dry shred staff that hath no whit
  Of leaf nor bark bear blossom and smell sweet
    Seek thou not any mercy in Gods sight
  For so long shalt thou be cast out from it"

  Yea what if driedup stems wax red and green
  Shall that thing be which is not nor has been
    Yea what if sapless bark wax green and white
  Shall any good fruit grow upon my sin

  Nay though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree
  And though men drew sweet waters of the sea
    There should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem
  This waste wan body and shaken soul of me

  Yea though God search it warily enough
  There is not one sound thing in all thereof
    Though he search all my veins through searching them
  He shall find nothing whole therein but love

  For I came home right heavy with small cheer
  And lo my love mine own souls heart more dear
    Than mine own soul more beautiful than God
  Who hath my being between the hands of her

  Fair still but fair for no man saving me
  As when she came out of the naked sea
    Making the foam as fire whereon she trod
  And as the inner flower of fire was she

  Yea she laid hold upon me and her mouth
  Clove unto mine as soul to body doth
    And laughing made her lips luxurious
  Her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south

  Strange spice and flower strange savour of crushed fruit
  And perfume the swart kings tread underfoot
    For pleasure when their minds wax amorous
  Charred frankincense and grated sandalroot

  And I forgot fear and all weary things
  All ended prayers and perished thanksgivings
    Feeling her face with all her eager hair
  Cleave to me clinging as a fire that clings

  To the body and to the raiment burning them
  As after death I know that suchlike flame
    Shall cleave to me for ever yea what care
  Albeit I burn then having felt the same

  Ah love there is no better life than this
  To have known love how bitter a thing it is
    And afterward be cast out of Gods sight
  Yea these that know not shall they have such bliss

  High up in barren heaven before his face
  As we twain in the heavyhearted place
    Remembering love and all the dead delight
  And all that time was sweet with for a space

  For till the thunder in the trumpet be
  Soul may divide from body but not we
    One from another I hold thee with my hand
  I let mine eyes have all their will of thee

  I seal myself upon thee with my might
  Abiding alway out of all mens sight
    Until God loosen over sea and land
  The thunder of the trumpets of the night
