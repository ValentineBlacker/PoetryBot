
Little 
rose 
roselet 
at times 
tiny and naked 
it seems 
as though you would fit 
in one of my hands 
as though Ill clasp you like this 
and carry you to my mouth 
but 
suddenly 
my feet touch your feet and my mouth your lips 
you have grown 
your shoulders rise like two hills 
your breasts wander over my breast 
my arm scarcely manages to encircle the thin 
new-moon line of your waist 
in love you have loosened yourself like sea water 
I can scarcely measure the skys most spacious eyes 
and I lean down to your mouth to kiss the earth







I have named you queen 
There are taller ones than you taller 
There are purer ones than you purer 
There are lovelier than you lovelier

But you are the queen

When you go through the streets 
no one recognizes you 
No one sees your crystal crown no one looks 
at the carpet of red gold 
that you tread as you pass 
the nonexistent carpet

And when you appear all the rivers sound 
in my body bells 
shake the sky and a hymn fills the world

Only you and I 
only you and I my love 
listen to it






Your whole body has 
a fullness or a gentleness destined for me

When I move my hand up 
I find in each place a dove 
that was seeking me as 
if they had love made you of clay 
for my own potters hands

Your knees your breasts 
your waist 
are missing parts of me like the hollow 
of a thirsty earth 
from which they broke off 
a form 
and together 
we are complete like a single river 
like a single grain of sand





Today this day was a brimming cup 
today this day was the immense wave 
today it was all the earth

Today the stormy sea 
lifted us in a kiss 
so high that we trembled 
in a lightningflash 
and tied we went down 
to sink without untwining

Today our bodies became vast 
they grew to the edge of the world 
and rolled melting 
into a single drop of wax or meteor

Between you and me a new door opened 
and someone still faceless 
was waiting for us there





When I can not look at your face 
I look at your feet

Your feet of arched bone 
your hard little feet

I know that they support you 
and that your gentle weight 
rises upon them

Your waist and your breasts 
the doubled purple 
of your nipples 
the sockets of your eyes 
that have just flown away 
your wide fruit mouth 
your red tresses 
my little tower

But I love your feet 
only because they walked 
upon the earth and upon the wind and upon 
the waters 
until they found me






When your hands go out 
love toward mine 
what do they bring me flying 
Why did they stop 
at my mouth suddenly 
why do I recognize them 
as if then before 
I had touched them 
as if before they existed 
they had passed over 
my forehead my waist

Their softness came 
flying over time 
over the sea over the smoke 
over the spring and when you placed 
your hands on my chest 
I recognized those golden
dove wings 
I recognized that clay 
and that color of wheat

All the years of my life 
I walked around looking for them 
I went up the stairs 
I crossed the roads 
trains carried me 
waters brought me
and in the skin of the grapes 
I thought I touched you 
The wood suddenly 
brought me your touch 
the almond announced to me 
your secret softness 
until your hands 
closed on my chest 
and there like two wings 
they ended their journey





Take bread away from me if you wish 
take air away but 
do not take from me your laughter

Do not take away the rose 
the lanceflower that you pluck 
the water that suddenly 
bursts forth in your joy 
the sudden wave 
of silver born in you

My struggle is harsh and I come back 
with eyes tired 
at times from having seen 
the unchanging earth 
but when your laughter enters 
it rises to the sky seeking me 
and it opens for me all 
the doors of life

My love in the darkest 
hour your laughter 
opens and if suddenly 
you see my blood staining 
the stones of the street 
laugh because your laughter 
will be for my hands 
like a fresh sword

Next to the sea in the autumn 
your laughter must raise 
its foamy cascade 
and in the spring love 
I want your laughter like

the flower I was waiting for 
the blue flower the rose 
of my echoing country

Laugh at the night 
at the day at the moon 
laugh at the twisted 
streets of the island 
laugh at this clumsy 
boy who loves you 
but when I open 
my eyes and close them 
when my steps go 
when my steps return 
deny me bread air 
light spring 
but never your laughter 
for I would die





My eyes went away from me 
following a dark girl who went by

She was made of black mother-of-pearl 
made of dark-purple grapes 
and she lashed my blood 
with her tail of fire

After them all
I go

A pale blonde went by 
like a golden plant 
swaying her gifts 
And my mouth went 
like a wave 
discharging on her breast 
lightningbolts of blood

After them all 
I go

But to you without my moving 
without seeing you distant you 
go my blood and my kisses 
my dark one and my fair one 
my tall one and my little one 
my broad one and my slender one 
my ugly one my beauty

made of all the gold 
and of all the silver 
made of all the wheat 
and of all the earth 
made of all the water 
of the sea waves 
made for my arms 
made for my kisses 
made for my soul




All night I have slept with you 
next to the sea on the island 
Wild and sweet you were between pleasure and sleep 
between fire and water

Perhaps very late 
our dreams joined 
at the top or at the bottom 
up above like branches moved by a common wind 
down below like red roots that touch

Perhaps your dream 
drifted from mine 
and through the dark sea
was seeking me
as before 
when you did not yet exist 
when without sighting you 
I sailed by your side 
and your eyes sought 
what now- 
bread wine love and anger- 
I heap upon you 
because you are the cup 
that was waiting for the gifts of my life

I have slept with you 
all night long while 
the dark earth spins 
with the living and the dead 
and on waking suddenly 
in the midst of the shadow 
my arm encircled your waist

Neither night 
nor sleep could separate us

I have slept with you 
and on waking your mouth 
come from your dream 
gave me the taste of earth 
of sea water of seaweed 
of the depths of your life 
and I received your kiss 
moistened by the dawn 
as if it came to me 
from the sea that surrounds us



The wind is a horse 
hear how he runs 
through the sea through the sky

He wants to take me listen 
how he roves the world 
to take me far away

Hide me in your arms 
just for this night 
while the rain breaks 
against sea and earth 
its innumerable mouth

Listen how the wind 
calls to me galloping 
to take me far away

With your brow on my brow 
with your mouth on my mouth 
our bodies tied 
to the love that consumes us 
let the wind pass 
and not take me away

Let the wind rush 
crowned with foam 
let it call to me 
and seek me galloping in the shadow 
while I sunk 
beneath your big eyes 
just for this night 
shall rest my love




Do you see these hands They have measured 
the earth they have separated 
minerals and cereals 
they have made peace and war 
they have demolished the distances 
of all the seas and rivers 
and yet 
when they move over you 
little one 
grain of wheat swallow 
they can not encompass you 
they are weary seeking 
the twin doves 
that rest or fly in your breast 
they travel the distances of your legs 
they coil in the light of your waist 
For me you are a treasure more laden 
with immensity than the sea and its branches 
and you are white and blue and spacious like 
the earth at vintage time 
In that territory 
from your feet to your brow 
walking walking walking 
I shall spend my life



Lovely one 
just as on the cool stone 
of the spring the water 
opens a wide flash of foam 
so is the smile of your face 
lovely one

Lovely one 
with delicate hands and slender feet 
like a silver pony 
walking flower of the world 
thus I see you 
lovely one

Lovely one 
with a nest of copper entangled 
on your head a nest 
the color of dark honey 
where my heart burns and rests 
lovely one

Lovely one 
your eyes are too big for your face 
your eyes are too big for the earth

There are countries there are rivers
in your eyes 
my country as In your eyes 
I walk through them 
they light the world 
through which I walk 
lovely one

Lovely one 
your breasts are like two loaves made 
of grainy earth and golden moon 
lovely one

Lovely one 
your waist 
my arm shaped it like a river when 
it flowed a thousand years through your sweet body 
lovely one

Lovely one 
there is nothing like your hips 
perhaps earth has 
in some hidden place 
the curve and the fragrance of your body 
perhaps in some place 
lovely one

Lovely one my lovely one 
your voice your skin your nails 
lovely one my lovely one 
your being your light your shadow 
lovely one 
all that is mine lovely one 
all that is mine my dear 
when you walk or rest 
when you sing or sleep 
when you suffer or dream 
always 
when you are near or far
always 
you are mine my lovely one 
always




In the night we shall go in 
to steal 
a flowering branch

We shall climb over the wall 
in the darkness of the alien garden 
two shadows in the shadow

Winter is not yet gone 
and the apple tree appears 
suddenly changed 
into a cascade of fragrant stars

In the night we shall go in 
up to its trembling firmament 
and your little hands and mine 
will steal the stars

And silently 
to our house 
in the night and the shadow 
with your steps will enter 
perfumes silent step 
and with starry feet 
the clear body of spring




Ah son do you know do you know 
where you come from

From a lake with white 
and hungry gulls

Next to the water of winter 
she and I raised 
a red bonfire 
wearing out our lips 
from kissing each others souls 
casting all into the fire 
burning our lives

Thats how you came into the world

But she to see me 
and to see you one day 
crossed the seas 
and I to clasp 
her tiny waist 
walked all the earth 
with wars and mountains 
with sands and thorns

Thats how you came into the world

You come from so many places 
from the water and the earth 
from the fire and the snow 
from so far away you journey 
toward the two of us 
from the terrible love 
that has enchained us

that we want to know 
what youre like what you say to us 
because you know more 
about the world we gave you

Like a great storm 
we shook 
the tree of life 
down to the hiddenmost 
fibers of the roots 
and you appear now 
singing in the foliage 
in the highest branch 
that with you we reach


The green earth has yielded 
to everything yellow gold harvests 
farms leaves grain 
but when autumn rises 
with its spacious banner 
it is you that I see 
for me it is your hair 
that separates the tassels

I see the monuments 
of ancient broken stone 
but if I touch 
the stone scar 
your body responds to me 
my fingers recognize suddenly shivering 
your warm sweetness

I pass among the heroes 
recently decorated 
by the earth and the dust 
and behind them silent 
with your tiny steps is it you or not you 
Yesterday when they pulled up 
by the roots to have a look at it 
the old dwarf tree 
I saw you come out looking at me 
from the tortured 
and thirsty roots

And when sleep comes 
to stretch me out and take me 
to my own silence 
there is a great white wind 
that destroys my sleep 
and from it fall leaves 
they fall like knives 
upon me draining me of blood

And each wound has 
the shape of your mouth




I have scarcely left you 
when you go in me crystalline 
or trembling 
or uneasy wounded by me 
or overwhelmed with love as when your eyes 
close upon the gift of life 
that without cease I give you

My love 
we have found each other 
thirsty and we have 
drunk up all the water and the blood 
we found each other 
hungry 
and we bit each other 
as fire bites 
leaving wounds in us

But wait for me 
keep for me your sweetness 
I will give you too 
a rose




I am the tiger 
I lie in wait for you among leaves 
broad as ingots 
of wet mineral

The white river grows 
beneath the fog You come

Naked you submerge 
I wait

Then in a leap of fire blood teeth 
with a claw slash I tear away 
your bosom your hips

I drink your blood I break 
your limbs one by one

And I remain watching 
for years in the forest 
over your bones your ashes 
motionless far 
from hatred and anger 
disarmed in your death 
crossed by lianas 
motionless in the rain 
relentless sentinel 
of my murderous love






I am the condor I fly 
over you who walk 
and suddenly in a wheeling 
of wind feather claws 
I assault you and I lift you 
in a whistling cyclone 
of hurricaned cold

And to my tower of snow 
to my dark eyrie 
I take you and you live alone 
and you cover yourself with feathers 
and you fly above the world 
motionless on the heights

Female condor let us pounce 
upon this red prey 
let us tear life 
that passes throbbing 
and lift together 
our wild flight






From your hips to your feet 
I want to make a long journey

I am smaller than an insect

I go along these hills 
they are the color of oats 
they have slender tracks 
that only I know 
burnt centimeters 
pale perspectives

Here there is a mountain 
Ill never get out of it 
Oh what giant moss! 
And a crater a rose 
of dampened fire !

Down your legs I come 
spinning a spiral 
or sleeping en route 
and I come to your knees 
of round hardness 
as to the hard peaks 
of a bright continent

I slide toward your feet 
to the eight openings 
of your sharp slow 
peninsular toes 
and from them to the void 
of the white sheet 
I fall seeking blind 
and hungry your contour 
of burning cup!






Whats wrong with you with us 
whats happening to us 
Ah our love is a harsh cord 
that binds us wounding us 
and if we want 
to leave our wound
to separate 
it makes a new knot for us and condemns us 
to drain our blood and burn together

Whats wrong with you I look at you 
and I find nothing in you but two eyes 
like all eyes a mouth 
lost among a thousand mouths that I have kissed more beautiful 
a body just like those that have slipped 
beneath my body without leaving any memory

And how empty you went through the world 
like a wheat-colored jar 
without air without sound without substance! 
I vainly sought in you 
depth for my arms 
that dig without cease beneath the earth 
beneath your skin beneath your eyes 
nothing 
beneath your double breast scarcely 
raised 
a current of crystalline order 
that does not know why it flows singing 
Why why why 
my love why






Facing you I am not jealous

Come with a man 
at your back 
come with a hundred men in your hair 
come with a thousand men between your bosom and your feet 
come like a river 
filled with drowned men 
that meets the furious sea 
the eternal foam the weather

Bring them all 
where I wait for you 
we shall always be alone 
we shall always be you and I 
alone upon the earth 
to begin life






If your foot slips again 
it will be cut off

If your hand leads you 
to another road 
it will rot away

If you take your life from me 
you will die 
even though you live

You will go on dead or shade 
walking without me on the earth





Love a question 
has destroyed you

I have come back to you 
from thorny uncertainty

I want you straight as 
the sword or the road

But you insist 
on keeping a nook 
of shadow that I do not want

My love 
understand me 
I love all of you 
from eyes to feet to toenails 
inside 
all the brightness which you kept

It is I my love 
who knocks at your door 
It is not the ghost it is not 
the one who once stopped 
at your window 
I knock down the door 
I enter all your life 
I come to live in your soul 
you can not cope with me

You must open door to door 
you must obey me 
you must open your eyes 
so that I may search in them

you must see how I walk 
with heavy steps 
along all the roads 
that blind were waiting for me

Do not fear 
I am yours 
but 
I am not the passenger or the beggar 
I am your master 
the one you were waiting for 
and now I enter 
your life 
no more to leave it 
love love love 
but to stay





I chose you among all women 
so that you would repeat 
on earth 
my heart that dances with tassels 
or fights without quarter when necessary

I ask you where is my son

Wasnt I expecting myself in you recognizing myself 
and saying to myself "Call me to come upon the earth 
to continue your fights and your songs"

Give me back my son!

Have you forgotten him in the doors 
of pleasure oh enemy 
waster 
have you forgotten that you came to this tryst 
the deepest one that one 
in which we two united will go on saying 
through his mouth my love 
ah everything 
that we did not manage to tell each other

When I lift you up in a wave 
of fire and blood and life 
doubles between us 
remember 
that someone calls to us 
as no one has ever called to us

and that we do not answer 
and we are left lonely and cowardly 
before the life that we deny

Waster 
open the doors 
and in your heart let 
the blind knot 
loosen and fly 
with your blood and mine 
through the world!






I have hurt you my dear 
I have torn your soul

Understand me 
Everyone knows who I am 
but that "I am" 
is besides a man 
for you

In you I waver fall 
and rise up burning 
You among all beings 
have the right
to see me weak 
And your little hand 
of bread and guitar 
must touch my breast 
when it goes off to fight

Thats why I seek in you the firm stone 
Harsh hands I sink in your blood 
seeking your firmness 
and the depth that I need 
and if I find 
only your metallic laughter if I find 
nothing on which to support my harsh steps 
adored one accept 
my sadness and my anger 
my enemy hands 
destroying you a little 
so that you may rise from the clay 
refashioned for my struggles





At times you sink you fall 
into your hole of silence 
into your abyss of proud anger 
and you can scarcely 
return still bearing remnants 
of what you found 
in the depth of your existence

My love what do you find 
in your closed well 
Seaweed swamps rocks 
What do you see with blind eyes 
bitter and wounded

Darling you will not find 
in the well into which you fall 
what I keep for you on the heights 
a bouquet of dewy jasmines 
a kiss deeper than your abyss

Do not fear me do not fall 
into your rancor again 
Shake off my word that came to wound you 
and let it fly through the open window 
It will return to wound me 
without your guiding it 
since it was laden with a harsh instant 
and that instant will be disarmed in my breast

Smile at me radiant 
if my mouth wounds you 
I am not a gentle shepherd 
like the ones in fairy tales 
but a good woodsman who shares with you 
earth wind and mountain thorns

Love me you smile at me 
help me to be good 
Do not wound yourself in me for it will be useless 
do not wound me because you wound yourself



Walking on the sands 
I decided to leave you

I was treading a dark clay 
that trembled 
and I sinking and coming out 
decided that you should come out 
of me that you were weighing me down 
like a cutting stone 
and I worked out your loss 
step by step 
to cut off your roots 
to release you alone into the wind

Ah in that minute 
my dear a dream 
with its terrible wings 
was covering you

You felt yourself swallowed by the clay 
and you called to me and I did not come 
you were going motionless 
without defending yourself 
until you were smothered in the quicksand

Afterwards 
my decision encountered your dream 
and from the rupture 
that was breaking our hearts 
we came forth clean again naked 
loving each other 
without dream without sand 
complete and radiant 
sealed by fire






I want you to know 
one thing

You know how this is 
if I look 
at the crystal moon at the red branch 
of the slow autumn at my window 
if I touch 
near the fire 
the impalpable ash 
or the wrinkled body of the log 
everything carries me to you 
as if everything that exists 
aromas light metals 
were little boats that sail 
toward those isles of yours that wait for me

Well now 
if little by little you stop loving me 
I shall stop loving you little by little

If suddenly 
you forget me 
do not look for me 
for I shall already have forgotten you

If you think it long and mad 
the wind of banners 
that passes through my life 
and you decide 
to leave me at the shore 
of the heart where I have roots 
remember 
that on that day

at that hour 
I shall lift my arms 
and my roots will set off 
to seek another land

But 
if each day 
each hour 
you feel that you are destined for me 
with implacable sweetness 
if each day a flower 
climbs up to your lips to seek me 
ah my love ah my own 
in me all that fire is repeated 
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten 
my love feeds on your love beloved 
and as long as you live it will be in your arms 
without leaving mine






All of love in a goblet 
as wide as the earth all 
of love with stars and thorns 
I gave you but you walked 
with little feet with dirty heels 
upon the fire putting it out

Ah great love small beloved!

I did not stop in the struggle 
I did not stop marching toward life 
toward peace toward bread for all 
but I lifted you in my arms 
and I nailed you to my kisses 
and I looked at you as never 
again will human eyes look at you

Ah great love small beloved!

You did not then measure my stature 
and the man who for you put aside 
blood wheat water 
you confused him 
with the little insect that fell into your skirt

Ah great love small beloved!

Do not expect that I will look back at you 
in the distance stay 
with what I left you walk about 
with my betrayed photograph

I shall go on marching 
opening broad roads against the shadow making 
the earth smooth spreading 
the star for those who come

Stay on the road 
Night has fallen for you 
Perhaps at dawn 
we shall see each other again

Ah great love small beloved!




You girls who were seeking 
the great love the great and terrible love 
what has happened girls

Perhaps 
time time!

Because now 
here it is see how it passes 
dragging the heavenly stones 
destroying flowers and leaves 
with a noise of foam lashed 
against all the stones of your world 
with a smell of sperm and jasmine 
next to the bleeding moon!

And now 
you touch the water with your little feet 
with your little heart 
and you do not know what to do !

Better are 
certain night journeys 
certain compartments 
certain most amusing walks 
certain dances with no greater consequence 
than to continue the journey!

Die of fear or of cold 
or of doubt

for I with my huge steps 
will find her 
within you 
or far from you 
and she will find me 
she who will not tremble in the face of love 
she who will be fused 
with me 
in life or death!






You have not made me suffer 
merely wait

Those tangled 
hours filled 
with serpents 
when 
my heart stopped and I stifled 
you would come along 
you would come naked and scratched 
bleeding you would reach my bed 
my bride 
and then 
all night we walked 
sleeping 
and when we woke up 
you were intact and new 
as if the dark wind of dreams 
had newly given 
fire to your tresses 
and in wheat and silver had submerged 
your body and left it dazzling

I did not suffer my love 
I was only waiting for you 
You had to change heart
and vision 
after having touched the deep 
sea zone that my breast gave to you 
You had to leave the water 
pure as a drop raised 
by a night wave

My bride you had 
to die and be born I was waiting for you 
I did not suffer looking for you 
I knew that you would come 
a new woman with what I adore 
out of the one that I did not adore 
with your eyes your hands and your mouth 
but with another heart 
who was beside me at dawn 
as if she had always been there 
to go on with me forever



In my country there is a mountain 
In my country there is a river

Come with me

Night climbs up to the mountain 
Hunger goes down to the river

Come with me

Who are those who suffer 
I do not know but they are my people

Come with me

I do not know but they call to me 
and they say to me "We suffer"

Come with me

And they say to me "Your people 
your luckless people 
between the mountain and the river 
with hunger and grief 
they do not want to struggle alone 
they are waiting for you friend"

Oh you the one I love 
little one red grain 
of wheat

the struggle will be hard 
life will be hard 
but you will come with me


Ah you dont want to 
youre scared 
of poverty 
you dont want 
to go to the market with worn-out shoes 
and come back with the same old dress

My love we are not fond 
as the rich would like us to be 
of misery We 
shall extract it like an evil tooth 
that up to now has bitten the heart of man

But I dont want 
you to fear it 
If through my fault it comes to your dwelling 
if poverty drives away 
your golden shoes 
let it not drive away your laughter which is my lifes bread 
If you cant pay the rent 
go off to work with a proud step 
and remember my love that I am watching you 
and together we are the greatest wealth 
that was ever gathered upon the earth





Ah how ill at ease sometimes 
I feel you are 
with me victor among men!

Because you do not know 
that with me were victorious 
thousands of faces that you can not see 
thousands of feet and hearts that marched with me 
that I am not 
that I do not exist 
that I am only the front of those who go with me 
that I am stronger 
because I bear in me 
not my little life 
but all the lives 
and I walk steadily forward 
because I have a thousand eyes 
I strike with the weight of a rock 
because I have a thousand hands 
and my voice is heard on the shores 
of all the lands 
because it is the voice of all 
those who did not speak 
of those who did not sing 
and who sing today with this mouth 
that kisses you







Stand up with me

No one would like 
more than I to stay 
on the pillow where your eyelids 
try to shut out the world for me 
There too I would like 
to let my blood sleep 
surrounding your sweetness

But stand up 
you stand up 
but stand up with me 
and let us go off together 
to fight face to face 
against the devils webs 
against the system that distributes hunger 
against organized misery

Lets go 
and you my star next to me 
newborn from my own clay 
you will have found tile hidden spring 
and in the midst of the fire you will be
next to me 
with your wild eyes 
raising my flag





In the midst of war life led you 
to be the soldiers love

With your poor silk dress 
your costume jewelry nails 
you were chosen to walk through the fire

Come here vagabond 
come and drink on my breast 
red dew

You didnt want to know where you were going 
you were the dancing partner 
you had no Party no country

And now walking at my side 
you see that life goes with me 
and that behind us is death

Now you cant dance any more 
with your silk dress in the ballroom

Youll wear out your shoes 
but youll grow on the march

You have to walk on thorns 
leaving little drops of blood

Kiss me again beloved






Ah yes I remember 
ah your closed eyes 
as if filled from within with black light 
your whole body like an open hand 
like a white cluster from the moon 
and the ecstasy 
when a lightningbolt kills us 
when a dagger wounds us in the roots 
and a light strikes our hair 
and when 
again we gradually 
return to life 
as if we emerged from the ocean 
as if from the shipwreck 
we returned wounded 
among the stones and the red seaweed

But 
there are other memories 
not only flowers from the fire
but little sprouts 
that suddenly appear 
when I go on trains 
or in the streets

I see you 
washing my handkerchiefs 
hanging at the window 
my worn-out socks 
your figure on which everything 
all pleasure like a flare-up 
fell without destroying you 
again

little wife 
of every day 
again a human being 
humbly human 
proudly poor 
as you have to be in order to be 
not the swift rose 
that loves ash dissolves 
but all of life 
all of life with soap and needles 
with the smell that I love 
of the kitchen that perhaps we shall not have 
and in which your hand among the fried potatoes 
and your mouth singing in the winter 
until the roast arrives 
would be for me the permanence 
of happiness on earth

Ah my life 
it is not only the fire that burns between us 
but all of life 
the simple story 
the simple love 
of a woman and a man 
like everyone






If suddenly you do not exist 
if suddenly you are not living 
I shall go on living

I do not dare 
I do not dare to write it 
if you die

I shall go on living

Because where a man has no voice 
there my voice

Where blacks are beaten 
I can not be dead 
When my brothers go to jail 
I shall go with them

When victory 
not my victory 
but the great victory
arrives 
even though I am mute I must speak 
I shall see it come even though I am blind

No forgive me 
If you are not living 
if you beloved my love 
if you 
have died
all the leaves will fall on my breast 
it will rain upon my soul night and day 
the snow will burn my heart 
I shall walk with cold and fire and death and snow 
my feet will want to march toward where you sleep 
but 
I shall go on living 
because you wanted me to be above all things 
untamable 
and love because you know that I am not just one man 
but all men





When I look at the shape 
of America on the map 
my love it is you I see 
the heights of copper on your head 
your breasts wheat and snow 
your slender waist 
swift throbbing rivers sweet 
hills and meadows 
and in the cold of the south your feet end 
its geography of duplicated gold

love when I touch you 
not only have my hands 
explored your delight 
but boughs and lands fruits and water 
the springtime that I love 
the desert moon the breast 
of the wild dove 
the smoothness of stones worn away 
by the waters of the sea or the rivers 
and the red thickness 
of the bush where 
thirst and hunger lie in wait 
And thus my spacious country welcomes me 
little America in your body

Still more when I see you lying down 
I see in your skin in your oaten color 
the nationality of my affection 
Because from your shoulders 
the cane cutter 
of blazing Cuba 
looks at me covered with dark sweat

and from your throat 
fishermen who tremble 
in the damp houses of the shore 
sing to me their secret 
And so along your body 
little adored America 
the lands and the peoples 
interrupt my kisses 
and your beauty then 
not only lights the fire 
that burns unquenched among us 
but with your love it is calling to me 
and across your life 
it is giving me the life that I lack 
and to the taste of your love is added the clay 
the kiss of the earth that waits for me






The taste of your mouth and the color of your skin 
skin mouth fruit of these swift days 
tell me were they always beside you 
through years and journeys and moons and suns 
and earth and weeping and rain and joy 
or is it only now that 
they come from your roots 
only as water brings to the dry earth 
burgeonings that it did not know 
or as to the lips of the forgotten jug 
the taste of the earth rises in the water

I dont know dont tell me you dont know 
Nobody knows these things 
But bringing all my senses close 
to the light of your skin you disappear 
you melt like the acid 
aroma of a fruit 
and the heat of a road 
and the smell of corn being stripped 
the honeysuckle of the pure afternoon 
the names of the dusty earth 
the infinite perfume of our country 
magnolia and thicket blood and flour 
the gallop of horses 
the villages dusty moon 
newborn bread 
ah from your skin everything comes back to my mouth 
comes back to my heart comes back to my body 
and with you I become again 
the earth that you are 
you are deep spring in me 
in you I know again how I am born



Years of yours that I should have felt 
growing near me like clusters 
until you had seen how the sun and the earth 
had destined you for my hands of stone 
until grape by grape you had made 
the wine sing in my veins 
The wind or the horse 
swerving were able 
to make me pass through your childhood 
you have seen the same sky each day 
the same dark winter mud 
the endless branching of the plum trees 
and their dark-purple sweetness 
Only a few miles of night 
the drenched distances 
of the country dawn 
a handful of earth separated us the transparent 
walls 
that we did not cross so that life 
afterward could put all 
the seas and the earth 
between us and we could come together 
in spite of space 
step by step seeking each other 
from one ocean to another 
until I saw that the sky was aflame 
and your hair was flying in the light 
and you came to my kisses with the fire 
of an unchained meteor 
and as you melted in my blood the sweetness 
of the wild plum 
of our childhood I received in my mouth 
and I clutched you to my breast as 
if I were regaining earth and life



My wild girl we have had 
to regain time 
and march backward in the distance 
of our lives kiss after kiss 
gathering from one place what we gave 
without joy discovering in another 
the secret road 
that gradually brought your feet close to mine 
and so beneath my mouth 
you see again the unfulfilled plant 
of your life putting out its roots 
toward my heart that was waiting for you 
And one by one the nights 
between our separated cities 
are joined to the night that unites us 
The light of each day 
its flame or its repose 
they deliver to us taking them from time 
and so our treasure 
is disinterred in shadow or light 
and so our kisses kiss life 
all love is enclosed in our love 
all thirst ends in our embrace 
Here we are at last face to face 
we have met 
we have lost nothing 
We have felt each other lip to lip 
we have changed a thousand times 
between us death and life 
all that we were bringing 
like dead medals 
we threw to the bottom of the sea 
all that we learned 
was of no use to us 
we begin again

we end again 
death and life 
And here we survive 
pure with the purity that we created 
broader than the earth that could not lead us astray 
eternal as the fire that will burn 
as long as life endures



When I reached here my hand stops 
Someone asks "Tell me why like waves 
on a single coast do your words 
endlessly go and return to her body 
Is she the only form that you love" 
And I answer "My hands never tire 
of her my kisses do not rest 
why should I withdraw the words 
that repeat the trace of her beloved contact 
words that close uselessly 
holding like water in a net 
the surface and the temperature 
of the purest wave of life" 
And love your body is not only the rose 
that in shadow or moonlight rises 
it is not only movement or burning 
act of blood or petal of fire 
but to me you have brought 
my territory the clay of my childhood 
the waves of oats 
the round skin of the dark fruit 
that I tore from the forest 
aroma of wood and apples 
color of hidden water where secret 
fruits and deep leaves fall 
Oh love your body rises 
like the pure line of a goblet

from the earth that knows me 
and when my senses found you 
you throbbed as though within you 
rain and seeds were falling 
Ah let them tell me how 
I could abolish you 
and let my hands without your form 
tear the fire from my words 
My gentle one rest 
your body in these lines that owe you 
more than you give me through your touch 
live in these words and repeat 
in them the sweetness and the fire 
tremble amid their syllables 
sleep in my name as you have slept 
upon my heart and so tomorrow 
my words will keep 
the hollow of your form 
and he who hears them one day will receive a gust 
of wheat and poppies; 
the body of love will still 
be breathing upon earth!



Thread of wheat and water 
of crystal or of fire 
word and night 
work and anger 
shadow and tenderness 
little by little you have sewn it all 
into my threadbare pockets 
and not only in the tremorous zone 
in which love and martyrdom are twins 
like two fire bells 
did you wait for me my love
but in the tiniest 
sweet duties 
The golden oil of Italy made your nimbus 
saint of kitchen and sewing 
and your tiny coquetry 
that tarried so long at the mirror 
with your hands that have 
petals that jasmine would envy 
washed the dishes and my clothes 
disinfected wounds 
My love to my life 
you came prepared 
as a poppy and as a guerrilla fighter 
silken is the splendor that I stroke 
with the hunger and thirst 
that I brought to this world only for you 
and behind the silk 
the girl of iron 
who will fight at my side 
Love love here we are 
Silk and metal come close to my mouth



And because Love fights 
not only in its burning agriculture 
but in the mouths of men and women 
I shall end up by attacking 
those who between my breast and your fragrance 
try to interpose their dark foot 
They will tell you nothing 
worse about me my love 
than what I told you 
I lived in the meadows 
before I knew you 
and I did not wait for love but lay 
in ambush and jumped upon the rose

What more can they tell you 
I am not good or bad just a man 
and they will then add the danger 
of my life which you know 
and which with your passion you have shared 
Well this danger is 
danger of love of complete love 
toward all of life 
toward all lives 
and if this love brings 
death or prison 
I am sure that your big eyes 
as when I kiss them 
will then close with pride 
with double pride my love 
with your pride and mine 
But toward my ears they will first come 
to undermine the tower 
of the sweet and harsh love that binds us 
and they will say "That one 
that you love 
is no woman for you 
why do you love her I think 
you could find one more beautiful 
more serious more profound 
more other you understand look at her how flighty 
and what a head she has 
and look at her how she dresses 
and so on and on" 
And I in these lines say 
thus I love you love 
love thus I love you 
thus as you dress 
and as your hair 
lifts up and as 
your mouth smiles

light as the water 
from the spring upon the pure stones 
thus I love you beloved 
Of bread I do not ask that it teach me 
but that it not fail me 
during each day of life 
I know nothing of light where 
it comes from or where it goes 
I only want light to light 
I do not ask explanations 
of the night 
I wait for it and it envelops me 
and thus you are bread 
and light and shadow 
You came into my life 
with what you brought 
I waited for you 
made of light and bread and shadow 
and thus I need you 
thus I love you 
and all those who want to hear tomorrow 
what I shall not tell them let them read it here 
and let them retreat today because its too early 
for these arguments 
Tomorrow we shall give them only 
a leaf from the tree of our love a leaf 
that will fall upon the earth 
as if our lips had made it 
like a kiss that falls 
from our invincible heights 
to show the fire and the tenderness 
of a true love





Do you remember when
in winter 
we reached the island 
The sea raised toward us 
a crown of cold 
On the walls the climbing vines 
murmured letting 
dark leaves fall 
as we passed 
You too were a little leaf 
that trembled on my chest 
Lifes wind put you there 
At first I did not see you I did not know 
that you were walking with me 
until your roots 
pierced my chest 
joined the threads of my blood 
spoke through my mouth 
flourished with me 
Thus was your inadvertent presence 
invisible leaf or branch 
and suddenly my heart 
was filled with fruits and sounds 
You occupied the house 
that darkly awaited you 
and then you lit the lamps 
Do you remember my love 
our first steps on the island 
The gray stones knew us 
the rain squalls 
the shouts of the wind in the shadow 
But the fire was 
our only friend 
next to it we hugged
the sweet winter love 
with four arms 
The fire saw our naked kiss grow 
until it touched hidden stars 
and it saw grief be born and die 
like a broken sword 
against invincible love 
Do you remember 
oh sleeper in my shadow 
how sleep would grow 
in you 
from your bare breast 
open with its twin domes 
toward the sea toward the wind of the island 
and how I in your dream sailed 
free in the sea and in the wind 
yet tied and sunken 
in the blue volume of your sweetness 
Oh sweet my sweet 
spring changed 
the islands walls 
A flower appeared like a drop 
of orange blood 
and then the colors discharged 
all their pure weight 
The sea reconquered its transparency 
night in the sky 
outlined its clusters 
and now all things murmured 
our name of love stone by stone 
they said our name and our kiss 
The island of stone and moss 
echoed in the secret of its grottoes 
like the song in your mouth 
and the flower that was born 
between the crevices of the stone
with its secret syllable 
spoke as it passed your name 
of blazing plant 
and the steep rock raised 
like the wall of the world 
knew my song well beloved 
and all things spoke of 
your love my love beloved 
because earth time sea island 
life tide 
the seed that half opens 
its lips in the earth 
the devouring flower 
the movement of spring 
everything recognizes us 
Our love was born 
outside the walls 
in the wind 
in the night 
in the earth 
and thats why the clay and the flower 
the mud and the roots
know your name 
and know that my mouth
joined yours 
because we were sown together in the earth 
and we alone did not know it 
and that we grow together 
and flower together 
and therefore 
when we pass 
your name is on the petals 
of the rose that grows on the stone 
my name is in the grottoes 
They know it all 
we have no secrets
we have grown together 
but we did not know it 
The sea knows our love the stones 
of the rocky height 
know that our kisses flowered 
with infinite purity 
as in their crevices a scarlet 
mouth dawns 
just as our love and the kiss 
that joins your mouth and mine 
in an eternal flower 
My love 
sweet spring 
flower and sea surround us 
We did not change it 
for our winter 
when the wind 
began to decipher your name 
that today at all hours it repeats 
when 
the leaves did not know 
that you were a leaf 
when 
the roots 
did not know that you were seeking me 
in my breast 
Love love
spring 
offers us the sky 
but the dark earth
is our name 
our love belongs 
to all time and the earth 
Loving each other my arm 
beneath your neck of sand
we shall wait 
as earth and time change 
on the island 
as the leaves fall 
from the silent climbing vines 
as autumn departs 
through the broken window 
But we 
are going to wait for 
our friend 
our redeyed friend 
the fire 
when the wind again 
shakes the frontiers of the island 
and does not know the names 
of everyone 
winter 
will seek us my love 
always 
it will seek us because we know it 
because we do not fear it 
because we have 
with us 
fire 
forever 
we have 
earth with us 
forever 
spring with us 
forever 
and when a leaf 
falls 
from the dimbing vines 
you know my love 
what name is written 
on that leaf
a name that is yours and mine 
our love name a single 
being the arrow 
that pierced winter 
the invincible love 
the fire of the days 
a leaf 
that dropped upon my breast 
a leaf from the tree 
of life 
that made a nest and sang 
that put out roots 
that gave flowers and fruits 
And so you see my love 
how I move 
around the island 
around the world 
safe in the midst of spring 
crazy with light in the cold 
walking tranquil in the fire 
lifting your petal
weight in my arms 
as if I had never walked 
except with you my heart 
as if I could not walk 
except with you 
as if I could not sing 
except when you sing



Farewell but you will be 
with me you will go within 
a drop of blood circulating in my veins 
or Outside a kiss that burns my Face 
or a belt of fire at my waist 
My sweet accept 
the great love that came out of my life 
and that in you found no territory 
like the explorer lost 
in the isles of bread and honey 
I found you after 
the storm 
the rain washed the air 
and in the water 
your sweet feet gleamed like fishes

Adored one I am off to my fighting

I shall scratch the earth to make you a cave 
and there your Captain 
will wait for you with flowers in the bed 
Think no more my sweet 
about the anguish 
that went on between us 
like a bolt of phosphorous 
leaving us perhaps its burning 
Peace arrived too because I return 
to my land to fight 
and as I have a whole heart 
with the share of blood that you gave me 
forever

and as 
I have 
my hands filled with your naked being 
look at me 
look at me 
look at me across the sea for I go radiant 
look at me across the night through which I sail 
and sea and night are those eyes of yours 
I have not left you when I go away 
Now I am going to tell you 
my land will be yours 
I am going to conquer it 
not just to give it to you 
but for everyone 
for all my people 
The thief will come out of his tower some day 
And the invader will be expelled 
All the fruits of life 
will grow in my hands 
accustomed once to powder 
And I shall know how to touch the new flowers gently 
because you taught me tenderness 
My sweet adored one 
you will come with me to fight face to face 
because your kisses live in my heart 
like red banners 
and if I fall not only 
will earth cover me 
but also this great love that you brought me 
and that lived circulating in my blood 
You will come with me 
at that hour I wait for you 
at that hour and at every hour 
at every hour I wait for you 
And when the sadness that I hate comes 
to knock at your door
tell her that I am waiting for you 
and when loneliness wants you to change 
the ring in which my name is written 
tell loneliness to talk with me 
that I had to go away 
because I am a soldier 
and that there where I am 
under rain or under
fire 
my love I wait for you 
I wait for you in the harshest desert 
and next to the flowering lemon tree 
in every place where there is life 
where spring is being born 
my love I wait for you 
When they tell you " That man 
does not love you" remember 
that my feet are alone in that night and they seek 
the sweet and tiny feet that I adore 
Love when they tell you 
that I have forgotten you and even when 
it is I who say it 
when I say it to you 
do not believe me 
who could and how could anyone 
cut you from my heart 
and who would receive 
my blood 
when I went bleeding toward you 
But still I can not 
forget my people 
I am going to fight in each street 
behind each stone 
Your love also helps me 
it is a closed flower
that constantly fills me with its aroma 
and that opens suddenly 
within me like a great star

My love it is night

The black water the sleeping 
world surround me 
Soon dawn will come 
and meanwhile I write you 
to tell you " I love you" 
To tell you " I love you" care for 
clean lift up 
defend 
our love my darling 
I leave it with you as if I left 
a handful of earth with seeds 
From our love lives will be born 
In our love they will drink water 
Perhaps a day will come 
when a man and a woman like
us
will touch this love and it will still have the strength 
to burn the hands that touch it 
Who were we What does it matter 
They will touch this fire and the fire 
my sweet will say your simple name 
and mine the name 
that only you knew because you alone 
upon earth know 
who I am and because nobody knew me like one 
like just one hand of yours 
because nobody 
knew how or when 
my heart was burning
only your great dark eyes knew 
your wide mouth 
your skin your breasts 
your belly your insides 
and your soul that I awoke 
so that it would go on 
singing until the end of life

Love I am waiting for you 
Farewell love I am waiting for you 
Love love I am waiting for you

And so this letter ends 
with no sadness 
my feet are firm upon the earth 
my hand writes this letter on the road 
and in the midst of life I shall be 
always 
beside the friend facing the enemy 
with your name on my mouth 
and a kiss that never 
broke away from yours
