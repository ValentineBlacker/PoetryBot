NEW YORK�According to a growing consensus of US poets shadows�inky sharp as a ravens beak�meet the sullen bloat of clouds their hues a pallid loam each a dancer each alone like dusty charcoal on an ashen brow

Citing both the ageless gloom of morning and a weary sun its astral luminescence wrapped in arid gauze the nations poets told reporters this week that doubt lingers in the frail minutes of a young dawn adding that said doubt
 was a heathen doubt�a fathers doubt�untouched by faith

Multiple verse-writing sources also confirmed vapors milky white vapors of shallow breath from a childs lips

"I take the cloth of fog I drape it over�gently like a midwife�the memory of one broken holy Friday" poet K Martin Echols said during a press conference Tuesday "Hallowed be regret and hallowed be my hands across the table 
where we ate where we wept where we fought the laws of bliss like lovers"

"For what is the sound of hope? For what is the minds moment of fulfillment?" added poet Willow Marks "For what is�?"

Coming just weeks after  US poets announced that poplar leaves heavy with the dread of autumns looming song danced in trembling half-step�one two one two�an overwhelming majority of verse writers affirmed to reporters Tuesday
 that Michael /Michael / there is a quickness in the dreaming of the bird Michael / the bird that plucked your silver ring from the moss and kept it bright through passing storms

In addition a prostrate fir felled                                       

                                    yet knowing

                        The weight of age the burden of

Roots natures

                                    Broken vow begged

                                                                for time like water poetic sources confirmed

"chastity you who call yourselves chaste adieu streaming silken love me lines graceless through rough ears

a language unknown

a sound unheard

a thought crying out

for new thoughts" poet harrison janie IV told reporters emphasizing repeatedly that chastity chastity chastity chastity "is this what is to be made of my chastity? a christmas wish? a torn dress? a sign that says no? 
take me as an ideal woman

not your idyll

or take me as an idle man

removed of chastity

removed of hindered fuck

removed"

While experts believe the nations poets may make a statement on wisdoms supple strength of skin as early as late July sources in the poetry community were quick to emphasize FIELDSthese are not            
                 FIELDS            we speak of but stores of HOPE

At press time the nations poets reiterated the "tyranny of I when we are I unbound

and unloved deprives all �cape cod may 2012"
